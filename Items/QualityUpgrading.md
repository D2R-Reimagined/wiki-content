# Quality Upgrading	
[N] = Normal
[X] = Exceptional
[E] = Elite (*best*)

These are the three different tiers with [N] having the lowest level requirements along with the lowest defense on armor & weakest damage on weapons.  With [E] having the highest level requirements along with the highest defense on armor & highest damage on weapons.

It's important to note that even in the [E] Elite category, not all armor and weapons are equal.  If you are creating a runeword, it's important to take note of the str & dex requirements when picking a base.  While you can grab any random white chest piece you find to add sockets, a barbarian class should strive to find the highest Defense possible which is the Sacred Armor.

## When to pick a particular Armor or Weapon type
The most important time to put some thought into a certain type of Armor or Weapon is either when you are using the very expensive crafting system or when you are about to make an end game runeword item.

When you have a chest piece of armor where the base has 200 defense, if it has +200% Enhanced Defense from crafting or from a runeword then it would have 600 defense.  If you had a chest piece of armor where the base has 500 defense, then the +200% Enhanced Defense from crafting or from a runeword then it would have 1500 defense.  This becomes extremely important for physical damage classes when picking a weapon!

### Other times to pick a specific base
A) When you have an Orb of Conversion & want a chance at getting a certain unique item.
B) When you have an Orb of Assemblage & want a chance at getting a certain set item.
C) When you have an Orb of Infusion & want the best rare, picking the best item is key.

## What is possible in Reimagined
You can upgrade a rare, set or unique from [N] to [X]
You can upgrade a rare, set or unique from [X] to [E]

You can change a grey or magic item to white with the HEL+EL recipe
You can change that white item to rare with an Orb of Infusion, allowing [X] or [E] upgrades.

Using the gambling system in-game, players can obtain any specific item and rather quickly upgrade the base to the exact item you want.  Force it to white, punch the specific sockets needed for a runeword using magic jewels.  Or force it rare to be used with an orb at a chance of becoming a specific unique or set piece.  The end game crafting recipes hold exceptional power, but due to their high cost worth of ingredients, put extra thought into the base you want to use as that is used for the randomized crafted armor or weapon.

## Example of how to get a specific base for Orb of Conversion usage
Let's pretend you found an "Orb of Conversion" & you wanted a chance at getting the "Tarrasque Hide" unique chestpiece.  I will walk through the steps I typically take and add some pictures along the way.

We lookup the stats on the reimagined website, here in the picture we see that the base is a "Boneweave" armor.  

There are different websites you can visit, but the one I typically go to is here where I'll find the "Armor" or "Weapons" sections. https://www.purediablo.com/diablo-2

Since we are looking for a Boneweave, I will click on "Body Armor" on the website.
