<h1>Gems</h1>
<p>All gems now have a single quality level. Vanilla D2R gem qualities (e.g. chipped, flawed, normal, flawless, perfect) have been removed from regular drop tables.<br><br><mark class="pen-red">Some hard-coded drop tables (Andariel, Hell Forge, Gem Shrines) will still drop inferior gem types. Cube these with the Gem Bag for credits!</mark></p>
<p>All gems drop from monsters that are level 18 and up (roughly Act 2, Arcane Sanctuary), and require level 18 to use.</p>

<h1>Gem Storage: The Gem Bag</h1>
<p>All new characters start with a Gem Bag in their inventory, and replacements can be purchased from vendors should you somehow misplace it.&nbsp;</p>

<h1>How it works</h1>
<p>The Gem Bag is used to store large numbers of gems, and uses a "credit" system. Each gem added to the bag adds one credit.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Credits are universal allowing your to retrieve any of the seven gem types as needed.</p>
<h1>Storing Gems</h1>
<p>Transmute up to 99 assorted gems with the Gem Bag to store them. The Gem Bag itself can hold up to 65,000 gems!</p>

<h1>Retrieving Gems</h1>
<p>Gems can be retrieved using ‘grabbers’ (also purchased from vendors).</p>
<p>Transmute the Gem Bag with an appropriate Gem Grabber to retrieve a single gem.</p>
<h1>Gem Recipes</h1>
<p>The Gem Bag can be used as a Gem reagent for recycle and reroll recipes (as long as you have enough gems stored):</p>
<p>e.g. REROLL CHARM - Gem Bag (3 Gems) + Magic&nbsp;Grand Charm = New Magic&nbsp;Grand Charm (100% plvl)</p>
<p>If a recipe requires gems to modify an existing item then gems need to be used instead of the bag:</p>
<p>&nbsp;e.g. ITEM UPGRADE - Amulet &amp; Topaz &amp; Magic Jewel = +1 to Assassin Skills</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
