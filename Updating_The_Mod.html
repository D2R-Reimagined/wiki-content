<h1>Updating the Mod</h1>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4><strong>Updating from the same major version (1.x -&gt; 1.y)</strong></h4>
<p>When updating to the latest version of D2R Reimagined from a Previous Version here are the steps to follow.</p>
<ol>
  <li>Download the Latest Version from Nexus Mods</li>
  <li>Delete the `Merged` folder in your `mods` directory</li>
  <li>Extract the new version in the root of your directory</li>
</ol>
<p><br><strong>Why do we delete the entire folder?</strong></p>
<p>Sometimes the mod will delete files and if you simply extract over without deleting those files will still exist and could cause issues.</p>
<p><strong>Will my saves be okay?</strong></p>
<p>Unless explicitly expressed in the patch notes that a new save is required your saves are completely safe. They are stored in "My Saved Games" and not in your D2R Install directory.</p>
<p><br>&nbsp;</p>
<p><br>&nbsp;</p>
<h4><strong>Updating from 1.x to 2.x</strong></h4>
<ol>
  <li>Download the file where available</li>
  <li>Extract the files in the root directory of your d2r install</li>
  <li>Copy your shortcut you have created to launch the modded game</li>
  <li>Open the properties of your copied shortcut. Change the section that has `-mod Merged -txt` to `-mod Reimagined -txt`</li>
</ol>
<p>Now launch the game using your copied shortcut.</p>
