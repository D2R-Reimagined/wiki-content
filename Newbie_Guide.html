<h2><strong>Characters</strong></h2>
<p>- Skills cap out at 25 hard points, up from 20.</p>
<p>- Many skills and their synergies have been changed - you can see a summary of these changes in-game by pressing Escape and looking at the Class Balancing section.</p>
<p>- You can respec at any time by cubing a TP Scroll and an ID Scroll in the cube to give you a token of absolution.</p>
<h2><strong>Items</strong></h2>
<p>- Check the <a href="https://www.d2r-reimagined.com/">website</a> pages to look up runewords, sets and unique items</p>
<p>- Item names have been updated to show both their item level ( XX ) and quality:</p>
<p>[N] = Normal, [X] = Exceptional, [E] = Elite</p>
<figure class="image image_resized" style="width:30.3%;"><img src="/image.png"></figure>
<p>- Stacked Items: many useful miscellaneous items drop as 'stacks' (the + sign in the top-left is a visual indicator), which can store up to 100 in a stack. This helps with storing them without taking up lots of inventory/stash space.</p>
<figure class="image image_resized" style="width:30.4%;"><img src="/rune_stack.png"></figure>
<p>- Retrieve socketed items: you can purchase two different types of item from Blacksmith vendors that allows you to retrieve socketed items from weapons and armor.</p>
<p>- Re-roll Items into White Bases: Item + Hel Rune + El Rune, re-rolls the item as a white base with new affixes.</p>
<p>- Item Upgrades: Check the <a href="https://wiki.d2r-reimagined.com/en/Items/AddItemStats">Add Item Stat Recipes</a> page.</p>
<p>- Crafting: Check the <a href="https://wiki.d2r-reimagined.com/en/Crafting">Item Crafting</a> about how to craft various powerful items.</p>
<p>- Essence drops have been replaced by <a href="https://wiki.d2r-reimagined.com/en/Items/Orbs">Socketing Orbs</a>.</p>
<p>- Jewels can be used to 'socket-punch' items when you want a <a href="https://diablo2.diablowiki.net/Sockets">specific number of sockets</a> (as long as the item supports it).&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp; - Item Rarity = Jewel Rarity required to punch sockets with. * Note that number of open sockets is dependent on the ilvl of the item.</p>
<p>&nbsp; - All Elite Helms can roll up to 4 sockets in Reimagined!</p>
<h2><strong>Quality of Life</strong></h2>
<p>- Cube a rune or rune stack with an ID Tome to downgrade&nbsp;a rune to the next tier lower.&nbsp;</p>
<p>- Cube two of the same rune or a rune stack with a TP Tome to obtain a rune from the next tier higher.</p>
<p>- You can store all of your <a href="https://d2rr.wiki.gg/wiki/Gems">Gems</a> in a gem bag, and use the bag directly in lots of crating recipes without having to take gems out beforehand!</p>
<p>- Gem grabbers are used to retrieve gems from the bag. Gem grabbers can be purchased from most vendors.</p>
<p>- Infernal Keys can be stored in a Keychain, and extracted with the appropriate key grabber. Grabbers can be found at many vendors.</p>
<figure class="image"><img src="/keychain_3.png"></figure>
<p>- There is a charm ( <a href="https://d2rr.wiki.gg/wiki/Charms">Collin's Might</a> ) that allows your melee attacks to have splash damage that drops from Corpsefire in the Den of Evil on normal (once per game, and only if you don't have one in inventory already). It can be upgraded a number of times via cube recipes to deal more damage and have less penalties.</p>
<p><mark class="pen-red"><strong>Due to character file size limitations in place by D2R it is recommended to keep STACKED ITEMS, KEYCHAINS, and GEM BAGS in a SHARED STASH TAB to prevent items from disappearing.</strong></mark></p>
