<p><mark class="pen-red">Intro</mark><br>The Elite Druid in Diablo 2 Reimagined presents a fascinating and highly effective summoner build, largely centered around an often-underestimated Act 3 Enchant Mercenary. This build leverages the Merc's high-level Enchant skill to provide AR &amp; fire damage boost to a significant number of summons, creating an incredibly versatile and powerful army capable of conquering all content in the game on P8.</p>
<p>Here's a breakdown of its key features:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Massive Summon Count:</strong> The core of the build revolves around summoning an impressive 36 creatures, each benefiting from the Enchant Merc's buff. This sheer volume of attackers creates a screen-filling force that overwhelms enemies.</li>
  <li><strong>Act 3 Enchant Mercenary Synergy:</strong> The Fire Act 3 Merc's Enchant skill is the linchpin. While typically overlooked, in Reimagined, it provides a substantial flat fire damage addition (4k+at lvl95) to all summons, significantly boosting their offensive power beyond typical summoner builds. The Merc's survivability can also be surprisingly high with proper gearing.</li>
  <li><strong>Versatility and All-Content Viability:</strong> This build is designed to be effective against anything the game throws at it. The sheer number of summons, combined with the added fire damage, allows it to deal with various monster immunities and high health pools, making it excellent for general mapping, bossing, and even the toughest challenges like P8 Ubers.</li>
  <li><strong>Accessibility with New Mechanics:</strong> The introduction of new 2.1 unique jewel recipes, particularly for "Heaven" and "Fire" facets, makes acquiring the necessary gear for this build significantly more achievable.&nbsp;</li>
  <li><strong>Scalability (Optional Revives):</strong> While 36 summons are already formidable, the build has the potential to expand even further with an additional 60+ summons by including the ‘Revive’ oskill. This offers a path for even greater power and versatility, though it's highlighted as not strictly necessary for the build to excel.</li>
</ul>
<p>In essence, the Elite Druid build in Diablo 2 Reimagined takes a creative approach to summoner gameplay, transforming the Act 3 Enchant Merc into a powerful support engine that elevates a legion of summons into a force capable of dominating all aspects of the game, even on the highest difficulties. The improved accessibility of key unique jewels in version 2.1 further sweetens the deal for players looking for a fun and potent experience.<br><br>&nbsp;<br><mark class="pen-red">Stats</mark><br><mark class="pen-green">Strength</mark> - Enough to wear your gear<br><mark class="pen-green">Dexterity</mark> - Enough to wear your gear<br><mark class="pen-green">Vitality</mark> - Everything<br><mark class="pen-green">Energy</mark> - None<br><br><mark class="pen-red">Skills</mark><br><mark class="pen-green">1 Point :</mark><br>Oak Sage<br>Heart of Wolverine<br>Spirit Barbs<br>Carrion Vine</p>
