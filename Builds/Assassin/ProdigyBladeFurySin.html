<p><mark class="pen-green">25 Points :</mark> &nbsp;<br>Blade Fury - Main throwing skill that ricochets and gains more projectiles with level.

<p><mark class="pen-red">Gameplay</mark><br>The loop is very simple.<br>Call to arms/Buff → Teleport → Blade Fury --&gt; Win<br>Played essentially like a Multishot Bowazon with shorter range.&nbsp;<br>There are a few differences, you are tanky. Really tanky.<br><br><mark class="pen-red">Gear and Breakpoints</mark></p>
<p><mark class="pen-green">Important BPs to reach</mark><br>IAS - 22 (With level 15 fanaticism) - 9 Frames - Reaching these frames will make you a bit faster. They are not spectacular, but its good to have it.<br>FHR - 48 - You can try higher but here is a very comfortable spot. Don't try to stretch.<br>FCR - Not important - Push it if care, but it is a non factor.<br>FBR - 86 is ideal but hard to reach. Don't stretch if you can't</p>
<p><mark class="pen-green">Weapon - Splinterfreeze (Unique)</mark><br>Cold mastery, gives this weapon the edge over (Frostbite Shard). Uptier it, it matters for leech and gives a decent chunk of physical.&nbsp;<br>Upgrade with +511 Rainbow damage and 4x Cold upgrades.<br>Corrupt : +- All elemental damage</p>
<p><mark class="pen-green">Off-Hand - Monarch (Crafted - 2 All Skills +- Elemental%)</mark><br>Anything you get is good. Ideally some block if you aren't sure you gonna reach it, FBR is good, anything that can help with breakpoints, or some damage.<br>Sockets - Cold Facets<br>Upgrades - Max Res/ DR, if you don't care FBR<br>Corrupt : It's a costly craft, so get what you can if you dare.</p>

<p><mark class="pen-green">Helm - Nightwing's Veil (Unique)</mark><br>No brainer helm for cold builds.<br>Sockets - Cold Facets<br>Upgrades - Uncertain that cold skills upgrade work, I used All skill upgrade.&nbsp;<br>Corrupt - Don't need CBF so get whatever you can.</p>
<p><mark class="pen-green">Gloves - Any Elite Base (Crafted - +1 All skills - Crushing blow/level)</mark><br>Helps cap your pierce, much needed CB, OW for uber adventures.<br>Upgrades - 1x Pierce, 1x Open Wounds, 1x Crushing Blow<br>Corrupt - Crushing Blow</p>
<p><mark class="pen-green">Boots - Stallion Hooves (Unique)</mark><br>Too good to pass out. CB,DS,Dex,Max Damage. You won't beat it.

<p><mark class="pen-green">Rings</mark> - &nbsp;Fearie Ring / Jordan's Sigil<br>Fearie ring is hard to beat, but Jordan big number go boom. Hulk smash. Its rare as a unicorn so stick with Fearie until then.<br>Corrupt - PDR/MDR, Max Res<br>Upgrades - One of the rings has to have 2x Increased Attack Speed, to reach the break point. The other, you can cover whatever you currently need.<br><br><mark class="pen-green">Charm Inventory</mark>&nbsp;<br>Crafted All skills Charms or Enhanced damage/Strenght/Dex Charms<br>Beacon and Soulstone<br>Life and Death, Remembrance of glory, Conclave of Elements, Queen's Call, Nightshade (optional)<br>Crafted ED/Stats charms will cover requirements,attack rating, give some cold damage and physical damage.<br>After that you can stack +1 All skill charms for maximum damage.<br><br><mark class="pen-red">Hannah or Kyoko</mark><br>Matriacal Bow (Faith) - To ease up your rough IAS bp<br>Quiver of Resistance Slaying<br>Sacred Armor (Fortitude)<br>Andariel Visage (4 Bers)<br>Laying of Hands<br>Zero Effect<br>Kashia's Ward<br>Dual Chiad Halo, or IAS for BP, or All Skill for minor Might boost. Your choice.<br>Amulet - Even mara is good, she is not a pretentious girl and will wear whatever you give her, show some love tho.<br><br>So A1 Merc is here for Fanaticism and LR proc, so yeah, moral support. Don't expect any damage.<br>&nbsp;</p>
<p><mark class="pen-red">Conclusion</mark><br>I'm willing to give this barb build 10/10 just cause this class was neglected until now and its literally top tier compared to anything else.</p>
