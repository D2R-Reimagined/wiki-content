<p><span class="text-huge"><strong>Advanced Tweaks for Reimagined 2.04</strong></span></p>
<p><span class="text-big">Advanced tweaks like these are from the efforts of various gamers &amp; would not have been possible without the community on Discord. &nbsp;Please join the growing team of gamers &amp; let us reimagine the future together!</span></p>
<p><mark class="pen-red">IMPORTANT: Because most of the options below either adjust a single file or alter many files, when a new version of Reimagined gets installed you will have to reapply every tweak afterwards. &nbsp;Keep this in mind when deciding which of these are of interest. &nbsp;You could use them all together if you wanted, they are all optional.</mark></p>
<p><mark class="pen-red"><u>It is recommended to first experience the mod by itself as default before trying any of these advanced changes.</u></mark></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Typically until now the gamer was required to either edit or merge multiple folders manually, opening the door for user errors. &nbsp;Allowing the batch files to automate the overwrite should make turning on or off a modification extremely easy for gamers. &nbsp;Every .bat file is fully transparent, you are able to right-click and choose edit. &nbsp;Notepad shows the lines of commands &amp; Microsoft Command Prompt simply runs them as written.</p>
<p>The install bat file simply grabs one file and replaces the file used inside the real final directory the game uses. &nbsp;So double click the install to tryout the change, and double click uninstall to go back to the default.</p>
<h2>Short description of each advanced tweak</h2>
<p>MOST TWEAKS BELOW CAN BE INSTALLED OR UNINSTALLED BY SIMPLY RUNNING THE .BAT FILE.</p>
<p><u>Expanded Stash</u></p>
<figure class="image"><img src="/advancedtweaks/expandedstashpreview.jpg"></figure>
<p>This increases the shared stash tabs from 3 to 7. &nbsp;Every additional tab is able to hold 2.5M gold as well allowing for an additional 10 million more gold to be stored. &nbsp;More freedom with more storage.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><u>Forced Terror Zones</u></p>
<p>This forces the following very popular zones to always be terrorized! &nbsp;While changing your computer system's clock can extend throne of destruction or cow level tz sessions, instead this will keep these popular areas terrorized permanently makes your life easier.</p>
<p><strong>Forced terrorized zones:</strong> <i>Countess, Summoner, Nilathak, Andy, Meph, CS, Throne of Destruction, Baal, Cows</i></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><u>Potion &amp; scroll removal from most monster drops</u></p>
<figure class="image"><img src="/advancedtweaks/nopotionpreview2.jpg"></figure>
<p>With potions and scrolls no longer dropping from most mobs, missing important gear becomes less of an issue. &nbsp;They can still be purchased from the vendor.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><u>Remove the Splash Charm's effect graphic</u></p>
<p>By default when using the Splash Charm, a red swoosh effect is present letting the gamer know how large the area for the effect is covering. &nbsp;You can turn off this graphic, while the damage will continue to hit mobs making it easier to see things while fighting.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><u>Two Skills Per Level</u></p>
<p>By default characters earn 1 skill per level. &nbsp;This modification changes it so characters earn 2 skills per level. &nbsp;This will only work for characters that have earned levels while it was turned on. &nbsp;If a character has gained levels while this was turned on, then that character gets to keep those levels even after turning this off. &nbsp;The extra skills and attributes remain even when resetting your skills.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><u>Expanded Aspect Ratio limit</u> (xx% zoomed out)</p>
<p>This increases the viewable area on-screen, where Blizzard has allowed upto 19:10 ratio to be used in the game. &nbsp;This allows players to teleport horizontally faster than a typical 16:9 ratio. &nbsp;Currently the steps listed are for Nvidia video card users only &amp; works on 1080p and 4k monitors too.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><u>Much Faster Loading game</u></p>
<p>This reduces the amount of time it takes for both the game's initial loading and also reduces the loading screens when changing in-between acts/zones. &nbsp;This has been reported to remove microstutters &amp; slightly reduce the minimum system requirements (except for the hard drive game storage size requirement).</p>
<h2>REQUIREMENTS - two zip files need to be downloaded</h2>
<p>The first zip file is specific to where you have installed Diablo II Resurrected. &nbsp;This will contain the bat files allowing gamers to turn on or off the different tweaks. &nbsp;A large majority of gamers have the game installed in the default location. &nbsp;If you're not sure then do not worry as there's a solution for that in the next stage below.</p>
<p>The second zip file contains the modified files that the batch files will be pointing towards &amp; might change on every release of Reimagined. &nbsp;<mark class="pen-green">Hopefully this will be included in the final release of Reimagined as non-activated to simplify this even more.</mark></p>
<h2>IDENTIFY WHERE DIABLO II RESURRECTED IS INSTALLED</h2>
<p>For the large majority of players the the game is installed in the default location: C:\Program Files (x86)\Diablo II Resurrected</p>
<p>If you are unsure where your game is installed, <a href="https://wiki.d2r-reimagined.com/easyinstall/diablo_2_resurrected_install_location_finder.bat">Click HERE to download</a> and double click this .bat &amp; it will lookup the registry key displaying the games installed location. &nbsp;Press any key to quit or click the x on the top right. &nbsp;As an example below is the default location displayed from opening the bat file. <i>(battle.net's uninstall registry key shows the location, this is only reading the registry).</i></p>
<figure class="image"><img src="/easyinstall/diablo_2_resurrected_install_location_finder_example.jpg"></figure>
<h2>DOWNLOAD 1 OF 2 - THIS ONLY NEEDS TO BE DOWNLOADED ONCE</h2>
<p>Unzip the bat files anywhere on your computer. &nbsp;It doesn't matter from which folder you run them or if you delete the .bat files. &nbsp;You simply double click the install to activate a tweak &amp; uninstall to disable it. &nbsp;These bat files should not need to be changed when new Reimagined versions are released, so unzip them to wherever you'd like.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><mark class="marker-yellow">Yellow batch files shown further down on this page are all contained inside these zip files</mark></p>
<p>Almost everyone will want this first one made if your game is installed in the default location below:</p>
<p>C:\Program Files (x86)\Diablo II Resurrected Click HERE to download <mark class="marker-pink">password protected during testing</mark></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If your game is installed in a different location then instead pick from one of these other options to download:</p>
<p>C:\Diablo II Resurrected</p>
<p>D:\Diablo II Resurrected Click HERE to download <mark class="marker-pink">password protected during testing</mark></p>
<p>E:\Diablo II Resurrected</p>
<p>F:\Diablo II Resurrected</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>DOWNLOAD 2 OF 2 - CONTENTS CHANGE WITH NEW VERSIONS OF REIMAGINED</h2>
<p>This contains the Install (new tweak) and the Uninstall (default no-tweak) actual files being replaced that the mod will be using. &nbsp;Since this is unzipped inside the mod folder it's the same file for everybody. &nbsp;If certain files change in-between reimagined versions then this will need to be updated at the same time you update the Reimagined mod. &nbsp;<mark class="pen-green">If these contents gets added to the .7z base mod then this 2nd step will never have to be downloaded by players. &nbsp;Players wouldn't have to update anything.</mark></p>
<p>To install open the zip &amp; drag this into the Diablo II Resurrected folder to be merged with the mods folder, identical to installing the reimagined mod itself.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h1><u>Expanded Stash</u></h1>
<p>This increases the shared stash tabs from 3 to 7. &nbsp;Every additional tab is able to hold 2.5M gold, so this increases the total amount of gold that can be held too.</p>
<figure class="image"><img src="/advancedtweaks/expandedstash.jpg"></figure>
<p><mark class="pen-red"><strong><u>Before installing this you must empty your shared stash tabs or risk losing items!</u> &nbsp;</strong></mark></p>
<p><mark class="pen-red">You can create new character mules to temporarily hold the items &amp; then move them back after the installation.</mark></p>
<p><mark class="pen-red">Please backup your saved game folder too when first installing the Expanded Stash incase you make a mistake</mark></p>
<p>THERE IS NO UNDO FILE FOR THIS EXPANDED STASH. &nbsp;Backup your saved games before applying.</p>
<p><mark class="marker-yellow">Expanded Stash Mod Directory Install.bat</mark></p>
<p><mark class="marker-blue">Run this file above everytime a new version of Reimagined has been installed. &nbsp;If you have installed the expanded stash before, then skip the one below you are done!&nbsp;</mark></p>
<p>However if this is the very first time you're installing the Expanded Stash, you will need to install the second installer below which will remove/destroy items &amp; gold currently inside your shared stash tabs. &nbsp;Simply download that file and double click and you're done. &nbsp;NEVER INSTALL THIS SECOND INSTALLER BELOW AGAIN.</p>
<hr>
<p>First play Reimagined, confirm that your stash tabs are empty so you have nothing to lose. &nbsp;If they do have items, create a few level 1 characters and move the gear temporarily onto them before running this file. &nbsp;Never run this file again, even when new versions of Reimagined are installed.</p>
<p><mark class="marker-yellow">Expanded Stash Saved Game Install.bat</mark></p>
<h1><u>Forced Terror Zones</u></h1>
<figure class="image"><img src="/advancedtweaks/forced_tz.jpg"></figure>
<p><mark class="pen-red">Have the game closed before running the installer/uninstaller.</mark></p>
<p><u>This forces the following levels to be permanently terrorized:</u> Countess, Summoner, Nilathak, Andy, Meph, CS, Throne of Destruction, Baal, Cows</p>
<p><mark class="marker-yellow">Forced Terror Zones Install.bat</mark></p>
<p>You may want to undo this tweak later for the times you wish to do custom terror zone runs such as trav tz or a less popular area not covered by these forced zones. &nbsp;To undo this tweak, simply run the uninstaller below to replace the original file back for the default hourly tz rotations.</p>
<p><mark class="marker-yellow">Forced Terror Zones Uninstall.bat</mark></p>
<h1><u>Potion &amp; Scroll drop removal from most monster loot</u></h1>
<figure class="image"><img src="/advancedtweaks/beforeafter.jpg"></figure>
<p><mark class="pen-red">Have the game closed before running the installer/uninstaller.</mark></p>
<p>With potions and scrolls gone off the ground, missing important gear becomes less of an issue.</p>
<p>This will remove health &amp; mana potions along with scrolls from trash mobs, however certain boss/quest/champions may have forced potion drop rarely. &nbsp;After applying if you want potions or scrolls then visit the vendor.</p>
<p><mark class="marker-yellow">Potion Scroll Drop Removal Install.bat</mark></p>
<p>To restore the potions &amp; scrolls back to default where they drop again run the uninstaller below.</p>
<p><mark class="marker-yellow">Potion Scroll Drop Removal Uninstall.bat</mark></p>
<h1><u>Remove the Splash Charm's red effect graphic</u></h1>
<p><mark class="pen-red">Have the game closed before running the installer/uninstaller.</mark></p>
<p>When using the Splash Charm, a red swipe graphic is present letting the gamer know how large the area for the effect is covering. &nbsp;You can turn off this graphic, while the damage will continue to hit mobs making it easier to see things while fighting.</p>
<p><mark class="marker-yellow">Splash Charm Effect Graphic Removal Install.bat</mark></p>
<p>To restore the splash charm effect graphic back to default where it's visible again run the uninstaller below.</p>
<p><mark class="marker-yellow">Splash Charm Effect Graphic Removal Uninstall.bat</mark></p>
<h1><u>Two Skills Per Level</u></h1>
<p><mark class="pen-red">Have the game closed before running the installer/uninstaller.</mark></p>
<p>By default characters earn 1 skill per level. &nbsp;This modification changes it so characters earn 2 skills per level. &nbsp;This will only work for characters that have earned levels while it was turned on. &nbsp;If a character has gained levels while this was turned on, then that character gets to keep those levels even after turning this off. &nbsp;The extra skills and attributes remain even when resetting your skills.</p>
<h1><u>Expanded Aspect Ratio limit</u> (xx% zoomed out)</h1>
<p>This increases the viewable area on-screen, where Blizzard has allowed upto 19:10 ratio to be used in the game. &nbsp;This allows players to teleport horizontally much faster than a typical 16:9 ratio. &nbsp;Currently the steps listed are for Nvidia video card users only, works on 1080p &amp; 4k monitors too.</p>
<p>When playing on a non 19:10 display, this will introduce black bars on the top and bottom of the screen resulting in a little less visible area. &nbsp;However, the game will be zooming out to compensate, allowing for more loot to be displayed on screen at once. &nbsp;Allows you to see monsters further on the edge of the screen &amp; extends how far left and right you are able to teleport making runs go even faster.</p>
<p><mark class="pen-red">Only writing the steps for Nvidia Graphics card users for now. &nbsp;Will update for AMD users this summer. &nbsp;Note that Windows needs to be operating at this aspect ratio while playing the game in fullscreen to be successful. &nbsp;So limited visibility while alt+tabbing will remain until you quit the game and change back to your typical desktop resolution. &nbsp;Suggest trying this at least once, especially if playing on a larger display.</mark></p>

<p><mark class="pen-green">DELETING ALL GREEN TEXT WHEN RELEASED</mark></p>

<p><mark class="pen-green">-PROBLEM- Minor rejouv potions are no longer dropping, full ones seem to be dropping rarely as always. &nbsp;If someone can re-look through the default file &amp; identify a way to restore the minor potions dropping that would be helpful.</mark></p>
