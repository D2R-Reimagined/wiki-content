# Itemization Overhaul First Pass

- Please see [PR #802](https://github.com/D2R-Reimagined/d2r-reimagined-mod/pull/802) for detailed information.



# Treasure Drops

Vinge went to war with screen clutter

### Miscellaneous

- TP and ID Scrolls will now only drop in Act 1 Normal at half the rate as before.

- Gold drops now have about 0.2% chance to spawn, roughly, not including probabilities (It's closers to like 0.02 overall but there are a lot of enemies)

 - When cubed with bag adds 20-30 Gem credits to bag

   - Can cube up to 99 at once like gems

- Sunder Charms increase total drop to about 1.5% when they can (See Below Table)



### Potions

- Following the recent potion efficacy rework, potions of each tier will drop for longer before finding the next tier up

- Players will no longer see potions of previous tiers as they progress through each act and difficulty

 - HP/MP 1 & 2 and Rejuv potions will drop in Normal Acts 1-3

 - HP/MP 2 & 3 and Rejuv potions will drop in Normal Acts 4-5, and Nightmare Acts 1-2

 - HP/MP 3 & 4, and Rejuv potions will drop in Nightmare Acts 3-5

### Keys

- Can drop as a random drop from unique and otherwise unoccuppied super unique mobs at about 2% chance (See Table Below)

- Re-roll recipes have been made more expensive:

  - Pandemonium Key + Corruption Orb + TP Tome = Next Key (e.g. Terror -> Hate -> Destruction) (Tome returned full)

  - Pandemonium Key + Corruption Orb + ID Tome = Previous Key (e.g. Terror -> Destruction -> Hate) (Tome returned full)



### Orbs

- Orbs have been changed to prevent them from being force spawned when using the Find Item skill

- Orbs dropped in Normal difficulty will be unstacked so players know what they do the first time they pick one up

- Orb of Socketing and Orb of Corruption have about a 3.5% chance to drop when they can (See Below Table)

- Orb of Shadows has a 0.5% chance to drop when it can (See Below Table)



### Jewelry (Treasure Class: Jewelry, Jewels, Gems, Charms, Orbs)

- Each difficulty now has its own Treasure Class, allowing for scaling drop chances per difficulty:

  - Normal: Jewel 10% chance, Infusion 2% chance, Conversion 1% chance, Assemblage 1% chance

  - Nightmare: Jewel 12% chance, Infusion 2.8% chance, Conversion 1.4% chance, Assemblage 1.4% chance

  - Hell: Jewel 14% chance, Infusion 3.5% chance, Conversion 1.75% chance, Assemblage 1.75% chance

- Ring drop chance reduced by roughly 3.5% across all difficulties

- Jewels have been separated from Diamonds and thus given light beams



### Chests

- NoDrop chance decreased from 60 -> 20 (Down to 25% chance of nothing per pick from 55%. They randomly roll 4 times for an item on regular chests)

- Chest item quality from the best outcomes increased by 1 level

  - Players can now potentially find items from the next Act/Difficulty

    - e.g.: Act 5 (Nightmare) chests now have a chance to drop Act 1 (Hell) items



### Champions

- Now drop Potions that are one tier higher than current Act/Difficulty allows



### Cows

- Drop chances have been reduced slightly across all difficulties

- Cows will no longer drop Potions



### Super Uniques

- Griswold has updated rarity data and should drop more similar to other super uniques

- White Council Members no longer drop TZ only loot



### Act Bosses

  - Andariel:  

    - More Equipment

    - Less Jewelry, Jewels, Charms, Gems and Orbs

    - Now also drops gold

  - Duriel, Mephisto, Diablo:  
    - Less Equipment

## Sorceress

>Goal is to pull power out of the masteries and put them into the skills and synergies. Initially started because of various OSkills and Enchant, this initial pass has expanded to feel things out and swing a nerf bat at some outlier skills, and buff up some underperforming or cumbersome ones. Please give each element a try as well as some hybridization, the masteries still provide some power as 1 points, and synergies were cut back to limit them to the skill itself and 2 others and power pushed into the skill level 29+ curve damage instead of bloating the synergies higher. Definitely want a focused elemental build to be stronger, but would like other builds to be viable to at least farm with and have fun doing it.
