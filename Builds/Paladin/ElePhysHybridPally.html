<h2>Charms &amp; Sockets</h2>
<p><strong>Charms</strong>: We are going to use a Torch and Annihilus preferably Upgraded and and fully Upgraded Collins, Lightning//Phys//Fire Sunders Upgraded then focus on Large Charms with -enemy fire and light resist and Crushing Blow until we comfortably hit around 50% CB.</p>
<p><strong>Sockets</strong>: Who needs em? lol.</p>
<hr>
<h2>Mercenary Setup</h2>
<p><strong>Act 2 Might Merc recommended</strong></p>
<p><strong>Weapon</strong>: Infinity</p>
<p>This is all the really matters. &nbsp;We need this conviction for maximum Elemental devastation. &nbsp;The rest of his kit you can select for utility. &nbsp;If you need resists Humility or Sacred Aura armors are great. &nbsp; Kit him out however you'd like, just keep in mind him being alive is 80% of your damage</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Stats</h2>
<p><strong>Strength</strong>: Enough to equip gear.</p>
<p><strong>Dexterity</strong>: Enough for 75% block with Holy Shield active. (If you don't want to Smite ubers and would rather Zeal invest more here until you're 85% Chance to hit)</p>
<p><strong>Vitality</strong>: Dump all remaining points here.</p>
<p><strong>Energy</strong>: None.</p>
<hr>
<h2>Skills</h2>
<p><strong>Resist Fire</strong>: Max Its a Holy Fire Synergy</p>
<p><strong>Resist Lightning</strong>: Max Its a Holy Shock Synergy</p>
<p><strong>Fanatacism</strong>: Required for MAX IAS freames for zeal/smite</p>
<p><strong>Other Auras</strong>: Pre Requisites for Fantacism, 1 Point into Salvation.</p>
<p><strong>Combat</strong>: 20 point Zeal, 5 into Holy Shield.&nbsp;</p>
<p>((you can chose to go 1 point Zeal and put 20 into Salvation for more ELE damage but you'll not have the phys damage for very high light/fire immunes even with Conviction))</p>
<hr>
<h2>Breakpoints</h2>
<p><strong>IAS</strong>: Minimum 23%. Easily obtained just from our phaseblade base and the 30% ias from runeword</p>
<p><strong>FCR</strong>: 75% is nice for easy teleporting but we very rarely teleport.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Thoughts</h2>
<p>This pally with sub optimal gear easily clears all of P8 content and is fun to boot. &nbsp;</p>
<p>If you're looking for some screen clearing face smashing fun give this a shot you might just find your new main.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
