<p><span class="text-big">Advanced tweaks like these are from the efforts of various gamers &amp; would not have been possible without the community on Discord. &nbsp;Please join the growing team of gamers &amp; let us reimagine the future together!</span></p>
<p><mark class="pen-red">IMPORTANT: Because most of the options below either adjust a single file or alter many files, when a new version of Reimagined gets installed you will have to reapply every tweak manually afterwards. &nbsp;Keep this in mind when deciding which of these are of interest. &nbsp;You could use them all together if you wanted, they are all optional.</mark></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><mark class="pen-red">NOTE: These are advanced game changes, where extra steps are required beyond the basic game &amp; mod installation. &nbsp;Some of these were found by players &amp; others by the mod developers, so support is not guaranteed. &nbsp;Please follow the steps &amp; instructions. &nbsp;Be ready &amp; willing to reinstall the game if you make a mistake before continuing. &nbsp;<u>It is recommended to first experience the mod as it is before attempting these advanced changes.</u></mark></p>
<p><mark class="pen-green">Temporary notes for Vinge, Delegus, Bakeit to review in green at the very bottom of this page. &nbsp;Deleting all green text on final version. &nbsp;Curious on your thoughts</mark></p>
<p>Short description of each of the advanced tweaks. &nbsp;Click the the link on the left or scroll down for the instructions.</p>
<p><u>Expanded Stash</u></p>
<p>This increases the shared stash tabs from 3 to 7. &nbsp;Every additional tab is able to hold 2.5M gold, so this increases the total amount of gold that can be held too.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><u>Forced Terror Zones</u></p>
<p>This forces the following very popular zones to always be terrorized! &nbsp;While changing your computer system's clock can extend throne of destruction or cow level sessions, keeping these popular areas terrorized makes your efforts easier. &nbsp;Forced terrorized zones: <i>Countess, Summoner, Nilathak, Andy, Meph, CS, Throne of Destruction, Baal, Cows</i></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><u>Potion &amp; scroll removal from most monster drops</u></p>
<p>With potions and scrolls no longer dropping from most mobs, missing important gear becomes less of an issue.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><u>Remove the Splash Charm's dust graphic</u></p>
<p>By default when using the Splash Charm, a giant cloud of dust is present letting the gamer know how large the area for the effect is covering. &nbsp;You can turn off this graphic, while the damage will continue to hit mobs making it easier to see things while fighting &amp; is a little easier on your graphics card.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><u>Expanded Aspect Ratio limit</u> (19% zoomed out)</p>
<p>This increases the viewable area on-screen, where Blizzard has allowed upto 19:10 ratio to be used in the game. &nbsp;This allows players to teleport horizontally much faster than a typical 16:9 ratio. &nbsp;Currently the steps listed are for Nvidia video card users only, works on 1080p &amp; 4k monitors too.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><u>Much Faster Loading game</u></p>
<p>This reduces the amount of time it takes for both the game's initial loading and also reduces the loading screens when changing inbetween acts/zones. &nbsp;This has been reported to remove microstutters &amp; slightly reduce the minimum system requirements (except for the hard drive game storage size requirement).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h1><u>Expanded Stash</u></h1>
<p>This increases the shared stash tabs from 3 to 7. &nbsp;Every additional tab is able to hold 2.5M gold, so this increases the total amount of gold that can be held too.</p>
<p><mark class="pen-red">Before installing this you must empty your shared stash tabs or risk losing items! &nbsp;You can create new character mules to temporarily hold the items &amp; then move them back after the installation.</mark></p>
<figure class="image"><img src="/advancedtweaks/expandedstash.jpg"></figure>
<p><mark class="pen-red"><strong><u>Please backup your saved game folder too when first installing the Expanded Stash to avoid losing items!!</u></strong></mark></p>
<p>Inside the Expanded Stash 2.0.zip file are two folders:</p>
<p><i>"Diablo II Resurrected"</i></p>
<p><i>"mods"</i></p>
<p>The "Diablo II Resurrected" folder will be overwriting files inside your saved game folder and this only needs to be done one time, even when new versions of the mod are released. *WARNING*REMOVE ALL ITEMS FROM YOUR "Shared" STASH TABS ONTO MULES BEFORE INSTALLING OR THEY WILL BE LOST WHEN THE FILE IS OVERWRITTEN.</p>
<p>The "mods" folder will be overwriting the files inside your games installation folder. &nbsp;Everytime a new version of reimagined is released, you'll need to take this "mods" folder and overwrite the default's reimagined's 3 stashtabs.</p>
<p><strong><u>The first 4 steps only need to be done once. &nbsp;Never have to do these 4 steps again after a new reimagined mod is released.</u></strong></p>
<ol>
  <li>First play Reimagined, make sure your stash tabs are empty &amp; have no gear. &nbsp;If they do have items, create a level 1 character and move the gear temporarily onto them. &nbsp;<mark class="pen-red">Otherwise the next steps 2-4 will delete &amp; destroy all gear inside these storage tabs, make sure all tabs are first empty!</mark> &nbsp;Now close out of the game.</li>
  <li>Download the expanded stash zipfile here, save it somewhere and open it up.</li>
  <li>Navigate to C:\Users\(YOU)\Saved Games folder (replacing YOU with your windows account's name).</li>
  <li>Drag the "Diablo II Resurrected" folder from the .zip into this folder (on the side, not on top of the other folder). It will ask to overwrite up to 2 files, do so.</li>
</ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><u>The last steps listed below will also need to be done everytime a new version of reimagined gets installed.</u></strong> &nbsp;<i>Separating these steps to make future upgrading easier.</i></p>
<ol>
  <li>Download the expanded stash zip file from step two above.</li>
  <li>&nbsp;Navigate to C:\Program Files (x86)\Diablo II Resurrected folder</li>
  <li>Drag the "mods" folder from the .zip file into this folder (on the side, not on top of the other folder). It will ask to overwrite up to 6 files, do so.</li>
</ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h1><u>Forced Terror Zones</u></h1>
<p>This forces the following very popular zones to always be terrorized! &nbsp;While changing your computer system's clock can extend throne of destruction or cow level sessions, keeping the popular areas terrorized makes things easier.</p>
<ol>
  <li>Navigate to your game installation and find this file: \Diablo II Resurrected\mods\Reimagined\Reimagined.mpq\data\hd\global\excel\desecratedzones.json</li>
  <li>Backup this file somewhere else so that you can undo this tweak when you wish to run other Terrorized Zones not included in this list.</li>
  <li>Download the modified file here and replace it in the location shown in the first step.</li>
  <li><u>Now the following levels are permanently terrorized:</u> Countess, Summoner, Nilathak, Andy, Meph, CS, Throne of Destruction, Baal, Cows</li>
</ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h1><u>Potion &amp; Scroll removal from most monster drops</u></h1>
<p>With potions and scrolls mostly gone off the ground, missing important gear becomes less of an issue.</p>
<p>This will remove health &amp; mana potions along with scrolls from most trash mobs, however certain boss/quest/champions may have forced potion drops still. &nbsp;After applying if you need potions, visit the vendor.</p>
<ol>
  <li>Navigate to the treasureclassex.txt and open it with notepad.</li>
  <li>Press CTRL + F (or on the menu go to edit, find) and search for these two lines listed below. &nbsp;After deleting both lines, close notepad and click save &amp; both potion types should no longer be dropping. &nbsp;<u>Search for &amp; delete these two lines:</u></li>
</ol>
<p><i>hp1-5</i></p>
<p><i>mp1-5</i></p>
<h1><u>Remove the Splash Charm's dust graphic</u></h1>
<p>When using the Splash Charm, a giant cloud of dust is present letting the gamer know how large the area for the effect is covering. &nbsp;You can turn off this graphic, while the damage will continue to hit mobs making it easier to see things while fighting &amp; is a little easier on your graphics card.</p>
<ol>
  <li>Navigate to your game installation and find this file: \Diablo II Resurrected\mods\Reimagined\Reimagined.mpq\data\hd\missiles\missiles.json</li>
  <li>Right click on “missiles.json”, choose “open with”. &nbsp;Click “More Apps” and click on “Notepad” &amp; click “Ok”.</li>
  <li>Press CTRL + F (or on the menu go to edit, find) and search for these two lines listed below. &nbsp;After deleting both lines, close notepad and click save &amp; the splash damage cloud of dust will continue to damage mobs but the graphic will no longer show. &nbsp;<u>Search for &amp; delete these two lines:</u></li>
</ol>
<p><i>&nbsp; &nbsp; "proc_splashdamage_four": "warcry_shockwave",</i></p>
<p><i>&nbsp; &nbsp;"proc_splashdamage_five": "warcry_shockwave",</i></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h1><u>Expanded Aspect Ratio limit</u> (19% zoomed out)</h1>
<p>This increases the viewable area on-screen, where Blizzard has allowed upto 19:10 ratio to be used in the game. &nbsp;This allows players to teleport horizontally much faster than a typical 16:9 ratio. &nbsp;Currently the steps listed are for Nvidia video card users only, works on 1080p &amp; 4k monitors too.</p>
<p>When playing on a non 19:10 display, this will introduce black bars on the top and bottom of the screen resulting in a little less visible area. &nbsp;However, the game will be zooming out to compensate, allowing for more loot to be displayed on screen at once. &nbsp;Allows you to see monsters further on the edge of the screen &amp; extends how far left and right you are able to teleport making runs go even faster.</p>
<p><mark class="pen-red">Only writing the steps for Nvidia Graphics card users for now. &nbsp;Will update for AMD users this summer. &nbsp;Note that Windows needs to be operating at this aspect ratio while playing the game in fullscreen to be successful. &nbsp;So limited visibility while alt+tabbing will remain until you quit the game and change back to your typical desktop resolution. &nbsp;Suggest trying this at least once, especially if playing on a larger display.</mark></p>

<h1><u>Much Faster Loading game</u></h1>
<p>This reduces the amount of time it takes for both the game's initial loading and also reduces the loading screens when changing in-between acts/zones. &nbsp;This has been reported to remove microstutters &amp; slightly reduce the minimum system requirements (except for the hard drive storage size).</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><mark class="pen-green">Temporary notes to self, deleting this green section on final draft.</mark></p>
<p><mark class="pen-green">confirm permission from Delegus to post his Expanded Stash.</mark></p>
<p><mark class="pen-green">Have blue mods do a quick review over the code &amp; instructions. &nbsp;</mark></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><mark class="pen-green"><u>Can I upload the pinned expanded stash file onto the wiki website?</u> &nbsp;Is Delegus okay with that, and will it need to be updated with 2.04 arriving soon or often? &nbsp;Because the 2 skill file was on nexusmod, I wasn't sure if the tiny files listed here are allowed to simply be hosted on the wiki itself or not. &nbsp;<u>So no files beyond pictures have been uploaded by me yet.</u></mark></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><mark class="pen-green">While I (Slamina) have tested the expanded stash &amp; forced terror zones with success for weeks, I have not yet tested the potion drop removal or splash charm dust graphic removal.</mark></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><mark class="pen-green">The much faster loading game tweak I published on the other wiki but figured moving it to the new wiki would be helpful. &nbsp;This is a modification of an unmodded tweak that has helped hundreds of people on reddit, I simply tweaked it to work specifically on reimagined through some experimentation. &nbsp;It's worked great on 1.21.1, preview4 &amp; 2.01-2.03!</mark></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><mark class="pen-green">The Expanded Aspect Ratio limit is a new tweak I recently made &amp; have been using it for over a month. &nbsp;This is not mod specific &amp; will work in any version of resurrected. &nbsp;So I'm confident this will make a great addition for gamers to try &amp; decide for themselves. &nbsp;My father will be visiting this entire summer &amp; with his AMD videocard I can expand these Nvidia only instructions to include steps for all the AMD graphic card users too and add those steps for them. &nbsp;The extra visibility gives a slight advantage to Player vs player, however the Player vs Monster aspect is exceptional, allows for more loot to be shown on screen due to being zoomed out slightly. &nbsp;Blizzard scaled the aggro radius to max out at 19:10 so there's no unfair advantage, this is simply just another quality of life change. &nbsp;Thoughts?</mark></p>
