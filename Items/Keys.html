<h3><strong>Key Storage</strong></h3>
<p>The key storage is for holding multiple copies of Keys of Hate, Destruction, and Terror.</p>
<h3><strong>Acquiring</strong></h3>
<p>You can create the Key Storage by cubing one of each of the keys together + an ID Scroll. This will create a key storage with one of each key available.</p>
<h3><strong>How it Works</strong></h3>
<p>The key storage uses a "Credit" System where the amount of credits equal to the amount of keys stored inside of it. Each key is displayed seperately</p>
<h3><strong>Storing Keys</strong></h3>
<p>Simply cube the key you want to store with the key storage in the cube and you will add the credit count</p>
<h3><strong>Retrieving Keys</strong></h3>
<p>First you must obtain a grabber tool. You can purchase the grabber tools from Akara - They look like Ears</p>
<p>Cube the grabber tool with the key storage together and it will extract the key from the storage and use the credits that are in the key storage. <strong>If you do not have enough credits in the key storage for the item it will not work.</strong></p>
