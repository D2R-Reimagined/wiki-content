# Carnage build
## Summary:
This build really shines in v2.1.0, you can easily clear whole content without hesitation and even before sunders drops in TZ hell, nothing can stop you as you have both physical(Carnage) and magic dmg(berserk). Still not so fast on clearing maps like Soso or FOH paladin, but fastest melee I've tried so far.

Also is Uber strong on Ubers, with 108% crushing blow, strong life leech and high defense.

I enjoyed every kill on my way to 99. Still can be tweaked with item upgrades and more crafted charms, but even without them it is very viable build. Hope it will inspire you to make something similar.

## Gear
### How to get items quickly
Let's say you want to get Griefspawn, which is bramble mitts unique gloves. Gamble leather gloves, then use hel+el to clear it. Use orb of infusion to make it rare, then upgrade in cube to exceptional gloves and to Elite right after. Now it's time to use your orb of conversion to try your luck to get unique griefspawn. There is also way to reroll set items, amulets etc.

Also fastest way to get you elite version of weapon for RW. 

Also upgrade your gear, you can upgrade your 2h weapon 10 times. With corruption, 511% ED and elemental on top best weapon will be probably BOTD in eth weapon.
