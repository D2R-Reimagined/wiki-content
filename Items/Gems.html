<h1>Gems</h1>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Gem Storage</h2>
<p>You can create a stack of each quality of gem (up to 30). Combine 3 of the same quality and type of gem to transform them into a stack. Then in your inventory drag and drop the same type of stacks together, and you will add gems to the stack!</p>
<h2>Gem Bag</h2>
<p>How to make a Gem Bag:</p>

<h3><strong>Video of How the Gem Bag Works</strong></h3>

<h3><strong>What is the Gem Bag?</strong></h3>
<p>The gem bag is a custom item that can be used to store several gems of all kinds in it at the same time.</p>
<h3><strong>Acquiring the Gem Bag</strong></h3>
<p>You can create the Gem Bag by combining each chipped gem in the unstacked version together. You will need to use one of each gem as seen in the picture to your right. DO NOT STACK!</p>

<p style="text-align:right;">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align:right;">&nbsp;</p>
<h3><strong>How it Works</strong></h3>
<p>The gem bag uses a "Credit" System where the amount of credits equal the number of chipped gems it would take to get that item.</p>
<p>So here is a breakdown of the credits for each gem:</p>
<ul>
  <li>1 = Chipped Gem</li>
  <li>2 = Flawed Gem</li>
  <li>4 = Gem</li>
  <li>8 = Flawless Gem</li>
  <li>16 = Perfect Gem</li>
</ul>
<h3><strong>Storing Gems</strong></h3>
<p>Simply cube the gem you want to store with the gem bag in the cube, and you will add the credit count to the gem bag. You can store up to FOUR of the same TYPE and QUALITY of gem at the same time. For example: cube 1-4 chipped gems with the bag and they all get put into it.</p>
<h3><strong>Retrieving Gems</strong></h3>
<p>First, you must obtain a grabber tool. Each grabber tool corresponds to the version of the gem. So if you want to grab a "Perfect <strong>Topaz</strong>," you would get the "Perfect <strong>Topaz</strong> Grabber."</p>
<p>Grabber tools can be obtained by cubing any chipped gem in the unstacked version alone in the cube. This will turn into a grabber for that gem.</p>
<p>Cube the grabber tool with the gem bag together, and it will extract the gem from the gem bag and use the credits that are in the gem bag. <strong>If you do not have enough credits in the gem bag for the item it will not work.</strong></p>
<p>Cube a grabber by itself to cycle through the available grabber tiers to create normal, flawed, perfect, etc.</p>
