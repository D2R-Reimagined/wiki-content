Quality Upgrading	
[N] = Normal
[X] = Exceptional
[E] = Elite

These are the three different tiers with [N] having the lowest level requirements along with the lowest defense on armor & weakest damage on weapons.  With [E] having the highest level requirements along with the highest defense on armor & highest damage on weapons.

It's important to note that even in the [E] Elite category, not all armor and weapons are equal.  If you are creating a runeword, it's important to take note of the str & dex requirements when picking a base.  While you can grab any random white chest piece you find to add sockets, a barbarian class should strive to find the highest Defense possible which is the Sacred Armor.
