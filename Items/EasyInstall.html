<h1>Diablo 2 Reimagined - Easy Install</h1>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This Easy Install setup only works if your game is installed in the default location below &amp; should work for almost everyone:</p>
<p>C:\Program Files (x86)\Diablo II Resurrected <a href="/easyinstall/easy_install_preview3_for_d2r_on_default_location.zip">Click HERE to download</a> <mark class="marker-pink">password protected during testing</mark></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you are unsure where your game is installed, <a href="/easyinstall/diablo_2_resurrected_install_location_finder.bat">Click HERE to download</a> and double click this .bat &amp; it will lookup the registry key displaying the games install location. &nbsp;Press any key to quit or hit the x on the top right. &nbsp;Below is the default location displayed from the bat file shown as an example. <i>(battle.net's uninstall registry key shows the location, this is only reading the registry).</i></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If your game is installed in a different location then instead pick from one of these other options to download:</p>
<p>C:\Diablo II Resurrected</p>
<p>D:\Diablo II Resurrected <a href="/easyinstall/easy_install_preview3_for_d2r_on_root_d_drive_only.zip">Click HERE to download</a> <mark class="marker-pink">password protected during testing</mark></p>
<p>E:\Diablo II Resurrected</p>
<p>F:\Diablo II Resurrected</p>

<h2>How it works</h2>

<p>Easy as 1 2 3!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>There are two bat files &amp; a freeware command line version of 7zip included. &nbsp;This tool never needs to be redownloaded. &nbsp;Read the included readme file for more information. &nbsp;It's purpose is to simply make uncompressing future reimagined downloads even easier. &nbsp;No longer need any installed software to uncompress the Reimagined mod.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>After unzipping this, there is a new folder created called “Download Reimagined Updates Here” inside the game installation. &nbsp;You simply need to run bat file 1 which deletes all other .7z files inside this folder only. &nbsp;Next you'll need to download the Reimagined .7z off Nexus and save that inside this folder. &nbsp;Finally doubleclick the bat file 3 &amp; the reimagined mod will be uncompressed and overwrite your old installation. &nbsp;Your saved games are located in a different location and should remain safe when updating the mod.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Now the mod is installed! &nbsp;</p>
<p>Easy!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Bat files are fully transparent &amp; editable by right clicking and choosing edit with notepad. &nbsp;A bat file is simply Microsoft Windows Command Prompt executing commands one after another. &nbsp;Feel free to change the path to better suit your own needs if your game was installed elsewhere.</p>
