<p>Diablo 2 Reimagined - Easy Install</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This Easy Install setup only works if your game is installed in the default location below &amp; should work for almost everyone:</p>
<p>C:\Program Files (x86)\Diablo II Resurrected</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you are unsure where your game is installed, download and double click this .bat &amp; it will lookup the registry key displaying the games install location. &nbsp;Below is the default location displayed from the bat file.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If your game is installed in a different location then instead pick from one of these other options</p>
<p>C:\Diablo II Resurrected</p>
<p>D:\Diablo II Resurrected</p>
<p>E:\Diablo II Resurrected</p>
<p>F:\Diablo II Resurrected</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1. Open the file "1 FIRST RUN ME"</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>2. Now download the reimagined mod off Nexus &amp; save it to:</p>
<p>C:\Program Files (x86)\Diablo II Resurrected\Download Reimagined Updates Here\</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>3. Open the "3 REINSTALLS REIMAGINED MOD WITH NEW VERSION"</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Now the mod is installed! &nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Easy!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Incase you are curious what happened. &nbsp;Step one deleted previously saved .7z mod downloads in the step two location as we only want to install the fresh new one you were about to download. &nbsp;Step two was you downloading the compressed .7z file containing the mod. &nbsp;Step three the freeware commandline version of 7zip unpackaged the mod &amp; overwrote the previous version. &nbsp;Remember your saved games are safely stored in an entirely different section.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Bat files are fully transparent &amp; editable by right clicking and choosing edit. &nbsp;Feel free to change the path to better suit your needs.</p>
