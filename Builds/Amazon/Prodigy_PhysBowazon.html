<p>Physical Bowazon (2.0.5)</p>
<p><mark class="pen-red">Intro</mark><br>This physical bowazon build achieves seamless farming on high player count and extremely potent against tough bosses including ubers.<br>It achieves the highest possible attack speed breakpoint (7frames), has high crushing blow and critical/deadly strike and very high raw damage.<br>It is easy to play from mid to long range and it goes in the group glass cannon. It is not durable to tank or receive multitude of heavy hits.<br>However elements wont be a problem. So enjoy the class and the build.<br>It's the definition of machine gun.<br>&nbsp;</p>

<p><mark class="pen-red">Stats</mark><br><mark class="pen-green">Strength</mark> - Enough to wear your gear<br><mark class="pen-green">Dexterity</mark> - Dump everything here<br><mark class="pen-green">Vitality</mark> - 0<br><mark class="pen-green">Energy</mark> - Can be invested a bit while leveling, but 0 in Mid-Endgame<br><br><br><br><mark class="pen-red">Skills</mark><br><mark class="pen-green">1 Point :</mark><br>Dodge<br>Avoid<br>Evade<br>Critical Strike<br>Pierce</p>
<p>Really they are good enough already, Pierce will go up to 80%+ which makes your Quiver automatically cover 100% pierce.</p>
<p><mark class="pen-green">25 Points :</mark> &nbsp;<br>Inner sight - This is your butter<br>Penetrate - High AR is a must for this class. Ignore Target defense may help against normal enemies, but this secures it for everything.<br>Multiple Shot - Screen clear farming skill for non-boss enemies.<br>Guided Arrow - Bossing/Single Target skill.</p>
<p>Bonus 1 Point Wonder Tip:<br>A point in DECOY, can sound bad, but if you played before, you know very well how powerful it is. &nbsp;<br>Do not ignore it if you are having trouble or if your merc is dying too much. Just cast before raining Multishots or Guided Arrows</p>

<p><mark class="pen-red">Gameplay</mark><br>The loop is very simple.<br>Teleport--&gt;Inner Sight--&gt;Multishot for farming and general play<br>Teleport--&gt;Multishot when enemies don't need to be debuffed<br>Decoy--&gt;Multishot/Guided Arrow when you walking and taking it slow<br>Use Decoy whenever you like it to agro enemies/bosses.<br>(Decoy disappears when you teleport)<br><br><mark class="pen-red">Gear and Breakpoints</mark></p>
<p><mark class="pen-green">Important BPs to reach</mark><br>IAS - 142 - 7 Frame - It's very crucial to reach this attack speed bp. Otherwise there is no use for the Matriarchal Bow, you're just losing damage a lot of the fun this build offers.<br>FHR - 86 - You can try higher but here is a very comfortable spot. Don't try to stretch to 174.<br>FCR &nbsp;- 99 - If you can reach it, get it, its very fluid.</p>
<p><mark class="pen-green">Weapon - Broken Promise (Runeword)</mark><br>Superior Matriarchal Bow base, corrupt until you get ED and AR or ED and ITD. Upgrade the bow 6 times with ED and AR, 1 time with ED,AR and KB, 2 times with IAS.<br>At this point the bow is at 480%+ ED. It is your decision to either finish the last upgrade and cap ED at 511% or more IAS to hit your breakpoint. If you're in for the long run - ED.<br>Make the runeword at the end aiming for max ED.</p>
<p><mark class="pen-green">Off-Hand - Quiver of Amplified Slaying</mark><br>I don't believe this needs explanation. The quiver will give you an amp proc, help with IAS, cap piercing and on top has some skill and damage to boot.</p>
<p><mark class="pen-green">Armor - Fortitude (Runeword)</mark><br>Very high damage runeword that needs no explanation.<br>The base is your personal preference. But stick to a low strength requirement armor, you will get more damage in return.<br>Corrupt can be anything useful, I personally prefer HP. Since we don't have points in vitality, it helps a bit.<br>Upgrades Should be All Resistances +Max Resistances</p>
<p><mark class="pen-green">Helm - Fortitude (Runeword)</mark><br>Yes Fortitude in helm. Didn't notice this coming too.<br>Diadem base, corrupt should be Cannot be frozen. Upgrades can vary from what you want. &nbsp;<br>1 All Skills will grant you a small amount of ED and your passives and inner sight, but its not good in the grand scheme of finishing your character. PDR is the best imho, followed by HP as second best. So choose your poison.</p>
<p><mark class="pen-green">Gloves - Laying of Hands (Set)</mark><br>You are searching for IAS corruption. Everything else comes after. &nbsp;<br>Upgrade with Crushing Blow.</p>
<p><mark class="pen-green">Boots - Stallion Hooves (Unique)</mark><br>Too good to pass out. CB,DS,Dex,Max Damage. You won't beat it. For this class, Zero effect boots are completely out of the picture.<br>Haven't hit a good corrupt on these yet. Try to get a defensive corrupt.<br>Upgrades should be Max HP/Max Mana. Nothing else really stands out. But upgrading boots is one of the last things you wanna do.</p>
<p><mark class="pen-green">Belt - The Art of War (Unique)</mark><br>Can't be beat. With Strength to boot. Just bonkers belt.<br>Search for a defensive corrupt.<br>Upgrades are 150HP or 6all att/6all res. 6/6 is pretty good if you feel comfortable with your HP.</p>
<p><mark class="pen-green">Amulet - The Vanquisher</mark><br>Best in slot, cannot be beat.<br>Corrupt - Yeah right, good luck with that. Pray that it drops.<br>Upgrades - 1 to Class skill, but I personally think if you look at the endgame, 12 dex can make more impact. Depends how much you want additional skills.</p>
<p><mark class="pen-green">Rings</mark> - &nbsp;I have 3 suggestions here.<br>Seraphim - 1 all and ED. Pretty basic easy to find and corrupt ring. I don't think its a very good ring. You have way too much ED. But it should be the first decent you find.<br>If you breakpoints are good ignore this - Any decent rare/unique IAS ring or IAS corrupted unique<br>Whisp Projector - Spirit of Barbs. (Meme) Just more damage when out. (Situational use, when you really want to make fun of something in the game)<br>Upgrades - Max HP or PDR are the optimal choices, however if you have problems reaching your desired BPs, just use IAS of FCR upgrade.-</p>
<p><mark class="pen-green">Charm Inventory</mark>&nbsp;<br>Its a lot to talk about. I don't recommend min-maxing your inventory with Damage Small charms.<br>Part of the Bowazon is comfort farming and killing bosses quickly.<br>So my choice was +1 skillers and +damage roll on them, with a few of the Unique charms that give Stats/Res/Damage.<br>Don't forget your Sunder, Upped Anni and Torch. Its important.</p>
<p>But why?<br>Reason number one is you don't have pierce on your items so you need all skills to achieve 80% pierce and save points.<br>Reason number two is passives. I know what you think, but the result is decent and comfort farming.<br>Reason number three is that its just fool proof. Really, its important for a build.<br><br><mark class="pen-red">Emilio's Gear</mark><br>Mancatcher (Pride)<br>Sacred Armor (Fortitude)<br>Andariel Visage (4 Bers)<br>Dracul Grasp for life tap, else anything with IAS if you are chasing a BP<br>Zero Effect<br>Ogre's Embrace<br>Dual Chiad Halo, or IAS for BP, or All Skill for minor Might boost. Your choice.<br>Amulet is TBD<br><br>Emilio Should be using Might Aura. Pride will give you Concentration Aura. Both of these will boost your damage a lot. That's all you need to know about Emilio.<br>&nbsp;</p>
<p><mark class="pen-red">Conclusion</mark><br>The class is meant for people that like ranged gameplay and damage to boot. It does everything the game has to offer very well.<br>Enjoy and cherish it as it will make you happy destroying everything in your way as well as rich during the process.<br>My personal rating on this build and character is 9/10. Cause there is always more. Have fun.</p>
