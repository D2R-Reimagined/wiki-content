<h2 style="text-align:center;"><strong>Welcome to D2R Reimagined Wiki!</strong></h2>
<p style="text-align:center;">The D2R Reimagined Project is a community driven Diablo 2 Resurrected mod that breaths new life into Diablo 2 Resurrected while keeping a similar vibe to the vanilla game.</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><a href="https://www.d2r-reimagined.com/">Website</a> • <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/diablo2resurrected/mods/503">Nexus Mods Page</a> • <a href="https://discord.gg/5c2GrFQReE">Discord</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2 style="text-align:center;"><strong>Our Mission</strong></h2>
<p>Our mission is to provide a Diablo II experience that is both familiar and new. We aim to keep the core gameplay of Diablo II intact while adding new features and content to the game. We want to provide a fresh experience for players who have played Diablo II for years, while also providing a fun and engaging experience for new players.</p>
<p>Everything we do, regardless if that is the D2R Files themselves or any of the tooling we build, is open source. We believe that the community should have the ability to see and modify the code that runs the mod. We also believe that the community should have the ability to contribute to the mod and help shape its future.</p>
<p>Want to be apart of this mission? Join our Discord Server <a href="https://discord.gg/9zZkYrSA8C">https://discord.gg/9zZkYrSA8C</a> for more information on contributing and collaborating.</p>

<p><strong>Adding content</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>Use visual editor when creating a page. This will let you edit a page similar to a word document.</li>
  <li>If you are unsure of what to do or how to create a page, search for a few articles on the same topic and see what they look like. You can always view the source code in a wiki and learn from what others have done.</li>
  <li>An edit doesn't have to be massive; if you feel you don't want to create whole articles, then just fixing spelling errors and broken links is enough.</li>
  <li>Register to edit and track your contributions.</li>
  <li>Make sure URL's Match Snake_Case or Kebab-Case for naming for SEO purposes</li>
</ul>
