<p><mark class="pen-red">IMPORTANT: Because most of the options below either adjust a single file or alter many files, when a new version of Reimagined gets installed you will have to reapply every tweak manually afterwards. &nbsp;Keep this in mind when deciding which of these are of interest. &nbsp;You could use all of them together if you wanted.</mark></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><mark class="pen-red">NOTE: These are advanced game changes, where extra steps are required beyond the basic game &amp; mod installation. &nbsp;It is recommended to first experience the mod by default before attempting these advanced changes. &nbsp;Some of these were found by players &amp; others by the mod developers, so support is not guaranteed if the steps are not followed. &nbsp;Be ready &amp; willing to reinstall the game before continuing.</mark></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><u>Expanded Stash</u></p>
<p>This increases the shared stash tabs from X to X. &nbsp;Every additional tab is able to hold 2.5M gold, so this increases the total amount of gold that can be held too.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><u>Forced Terror Zones</u></p>
<p>This forces the following very popular zones to always be terrorized! &nbsp;While changing your computer system's clock can extend throne of destruction or cow level sessions, keeping the popular areas terrorized makes things easier.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><u>Removing Potions/Scrolls from most monster drops</u></p>
<p>With potions and scrolls mostly gone off the ground, missing important gear becomes less of an issue.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><u>Remove the Splash Charm's dust graphic</u></p>
<p>When using the Splash Charm, a giant cloud of dust is present letting the gamer know how large the area for the effect is covering. &nbsp;You can turn off this graphic, while the damage will continue to hit mobs making it easier to see things while fighting &amp; is a little easier on your graphics card.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><u>Expanded Aspect Ratio limit</u> (19% zoomedout)</p>
<p>This increases the viewable area on-screen, where Blizzard has allowed upto 19:10 ratio to be used in the game. &nbsp;This allows players to teleport horizontally much faster then a typical 16:9 ratio. &nbsp;Currently the steps listed are for Nvidia videocard users only, works on 1080p &amp; 4k monitors too.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><u>Much Faster Loading game</u></p>
<p>This reduces the amount of time it takes for both the game's initial loading and also reduces the loading screens when changing inbetween acts/zones. &nbsp;This has been reported to remove microstutters &amp; slightly reduce the minimum system requirements (except for the hard drive storage size).</p>
