<h1>Installation Guides</h1>
<p>Below is a compilation of useful information and guides.</p>
<p>Before getting started, take a second to make a backup of your files (this is always good practice before making changes)!</p>
<h3>File Locations</h3>
<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Mod Files:</strong> C:\Program Files (x86)\Diablo II Resurrected\mods\Reimagined</p>
  <p><i><strong>Save Files:</strong> C:\Users\&lt;YOURNAME&gt;\Saved Games\Diablo II Resurrected\mods\Reimagined</i></p>
  <p><i><mark class="pen-red">Your install and save locations may vary depending on your setup!</mark></i></p>
</blockquote>
<h3>Making Backups</h3>
<p>In File Explorer, navigate to your your D2R install and Saved Games directories.</p>
<p>Right click the directory, select ‘compress to…’ and choose ZIP file. Rename the ZIP file to something memorable, and move it somewhere easy to remember (e.g. your desktop).</p>
<p>Remember to periodically create new ZIP folders so that you don't lose progress in case of crashes, exceeding your save file data limit, etc..</p>
<h2><br>D2RMM</h2>
<p><a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/diablo2resurrected/mods/169">D2RMM on Nexus Mods</a></p>
<p>Using a Mod Manager allows you to easily install a variety of mods together (assuming they play nice) without having to know anything about modding.</p>
<h3><br>Reimagined Features:</h3>
<p>Reimagined is packed full of expansive features and QOL updates, so installing extra mods isn't always necessary.</p>
<p>If you have questions about whether something is included in Reimagined, or would like to see something added, DM one of the Devs, or post in the suggestions-and-feedback channel of our discord channel.</p>
<p>A number of Mod Creators gave express permission to include their mod in Reimagined. Where this is the case credit is given on the <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/diablo2resurrected/mods/503?tab=description">Reimagined Nexus Mods</a> page.</p>

<h2>Loot Filters</h2>
<blockquote>
  <p>This guide assumes you have already downloaded and installed D2RMM (see above)</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
  <p><mark class="pen-red"><strong>If you find Quilted Armor with no graphics, leave them on the ground. Do not attempt to identify or sell them.</strong></mark></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Reimagined doesn't yet include a built-in Loot Filter.</p>
<p>One of the most popular reasons to use a Mod Manager is to install a 3rd-party Loot Filter to help reduce clutter.</p>
<p>Below we'll take you through a step-by-step guide on how to install and configure a loot filter. We recommend <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/diablo2resurrected/mods/467">Pseudo Loot Filter</a>.<br>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>File Steps</h4>
<p>1. Open your D2RMM folder and navigate to the mods directory</p>
<ul>
  <li>You should see a text file called 'PUT YOUR MODS HERE' - leave this window open, we'll use it later</li>
</ul>
<p>2. Open a new File Explorer window and navigate to your Reimagined mod folder</p>
<p>3. Copy the Reimagined.mpq folder (this should contain Data and ModInfo.json)</p>
<p>4. Paste the Reimagined.mpq folder into the D2RMM/mods folder from step 2</p>
<ul>
  <li>Feel free to rename Reimagined.mpq to something that makes more sense to you (e.g. Reimagined)</li>
</ul>
<h4>D2RMM Steps</h4>
<p>5. Open D2RMM as Administrator. Once open, click the three dots in the bottom-right corner and select 'Refresh Mod List'</p>
<p>6. Reimagined.mpq should appear in the mod list (or whatever you renamed the folder to)</p>
<blockquote>
  <p><mark class="pen-red"><strong>The Reimagined folder must always be first in the list of mods. Click and drag the line to the top if it isn't.</strong></mark></p>
</blockquote>
<p>7. Navigate to the Settings tab (at the top)</p>
<ul>
  <li>7a. Click on General<ul>
      <li>Change 'Output Mod Name' to 'Reimagined'</li>
      <li>Toggle 'Automatically install mods before running the game'</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>7b. Click on Game Launcher<ul>
      <li>Under 'Extra Game Args', paste the following: -mod Reimagined -txt</li>
      <li>Feel free to add any other args you want here</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>
<p>8. Navigate back to the Mods tab</p>
<p>9. Click Install Mods</p>
<h4><br>Save File Steps</h4>
<p>10. In File Explorer, navigate to your Saved Games directory</p>
<p>11. Check the Reimagined folder - if you see your save files, you're good to go!&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
  <li>If the folder is empty, copy the contents from the backup folder you created earlier, and paste the contents in the empty Reimagined folder.<br>&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<h4>Final step</h4>
<p>12. Hit 'Run D2R' in D2RMM and have fun!</p>
<h4><br>FAQ:</h4>
<p>My mod isn't showing up in the mod list on D2RMM?</p>
<ol>
  <li>Either you didn't put the Reimagined.mpq folder in D2RMM/mods or it's in a sub-folder called Reimagined</li>
  <li>Run D2RMM as administrator</li>
  <li>You may need to follow step 8 to update the Output Mod Name</li>
</ol>

<h2>Coming Soon - Reimagined Desktop Launcher</h2>
<p>Allows you to very easily install/reinstall/update the Reimagined mod, make a backup of your saved game automatically when launching the game and much more. &nbsp;No more editing shortcuts, no more dragging and dropping files or folders.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>DOWNLOAD TWO ZIP FILES</p>
<p><mark class="marker-blue">Reimagined Desktop Launcher - unzip onto your Desktop.zip</mark> - Download this &amp; follow these install instructions:</p>
<p>Extract the folder inside of this zip onto your desktop. &nbsp;And after you've installed the next zip below, these bat files will each have a function.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><mark class="marker-blue">advanced tweaks.zip</mark> - These files might need to be updated in future reimagined mod versions, but for now should work on most versions of reimagined. &nbsp;Download this &amp; follow these install instructions:</p>
<p>Open your Diablo II Resurrected folder and unzip the “mods” folder into this folder, exactly the same as you manually would install the Reimagined mod.</p>
<p>The files included in this zip are used for the Reimagined Desktop Launcher to function properly.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><u>Can easily Install Reimagined</u></p>
<p>First you must download the reimagined mod off Nexus and save the .7z into the “Reimagined Desktop Launcher” folder on the desktop. &nbsp;Simply double click the “Install Reimagined (Install-Update)” &amp; the mod will get installed! &nbsp;Works if you've never installed the mod before, if you want to re-install the mod or if you're looking to update to a new version of the mod.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><u>Automatic Saved Game Backup</u></p>
<p>Running this both launches Reimagined &amp; also copies your Resurrected saved game directory into a new zip file at the same time. &nbsp;So by playing the game, you've just created a saved game backup. &nbsp;These new saved game backup zips are stored in a new location in: \Saved Games\Reimagined Automatic Saved Game Backups\</p>
<p>Play Reimagined (Daily Backup): Saves only one zip backup a day, overwriting that zip each time you play until the next day where a new zip will be made.</p>
<p>Play Reimagined (Session Backup): Saves a new zip backup everytime you launch the game. &nbsp;However, if you run the game 200 times you'll have 200 zip files to deal with using this option.</p>
<hr>
<h2>Reimagined Desktop Launcher - Advanced</h2>
<p>These are optional tweaks that can be installed very easily by simply double clicking the ones that are of interest to you. &nbsp;They are located inside the “Advanced” folder within the “Reimagined Desktop Launcher” folder on your desktop. &nbsp;If you simply reinstall the reimagined mod, then all the tweaks in the advanced folder reset back to being turned off again. &nbsp;This allows you to easily turn on or off any tweak.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><u>Expanded Stash</u></p>
<figure class="image"><img src="/advancedtweaks/expandedstashpreview.jpg"></figure>
<p>This increases the shared stash tabs from 3 to 7. &nbsp;Every additional tab is able to hold 2.5M gold as well allowing for an additional 10 million more gold to be stored. &nbsp;More freedom with more storage. &nbsp;This is Delegus's expanded stash &amp; may need to be updated with a fresh "advanced tweaks.zip” as it'll be included.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><u>Forced Terror Zones</u></p>
<p>This forces the following very popular zones to always be terrorized! &nbsp;While changing your computer system's clock can extend throne of destruction or cow level tz sessions, instead this will keep these popular areas terrorized permanently makes your life easier. &nbsp;This ensures key farming areas are always terrorized too!</p>
<p><strong>Forced terrorized zones:</strong> <i>Countess, Summoner, Nilathak, Andy, Meph, CS, Throne of Destruction, Baal, Cows</i></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><u>Remove the Splash Charm's effect graphic</u></p>
<p>By default when using the Splash Charm, a red swoosh effect is present letting the gamer know how large the area for the effect is covering. &nbsp;You can turn off this graphic, while the damage will continue to hit mobs making it easier to see things while fighting.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><u>Two Skills Per Level</u></p>
<p>By default characters earn 1 skill per level. &nbsp;This modification changes it so characters earn 2 skills per level. &nbsp;This will only work for characters that have earned levels while it was turned on. &nbsp;If a character has gained levels while this was turned on, then that character gets to keep those levels even after turning this off. &nbsp;The extra skills and attributes remain even when resetting your skills.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><u>Much Faster Loading game</u></p>
<p>Easy casc extraction, no more dragging &amp; dropping. &nbsp;Coming soon</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><u>Expanded Aspect Ratio limit</u> (xx% zoomed out)</p>
<p>Coming soon</p>
