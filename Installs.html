<h1>Installation Guides</h1>
<p>Below is a compilation of useful information and guides.</p>
<p>Before getting started, take a second to make a backup of your files (this is always good practice before making changes)!</p>
<h3>File Locations</h3>
<blockquote>
  <p><mark class="pen-green"><strong>Mod Files:</strong></mark> <code>C:\Program Files (x86)\Diablo II Resurrected\mods\Reimagined</code></p>
  <p><i><mark class="pen-green"><strong>Save Files:</strong></mark> </i><code><i>C:\Users\</i>%USERPROFILE%<i>\Saved Games\Diablo II Resurrected\mods\Reimagined</i></code></p>
  <p><i><mark class="pen-red">Your install and save locations may vary depending on your setup!</mark></i></p>
  <p><i><mark class="pen-red">We aren't IT support, find your install and saved game directories if it differs from the above (you may have installed D2R on a different drive; you use D2RMM, etc.)</mark></i></p>
</blockquote>
<h3>Making Backups (Manual Steps)</h3>
<p>In File Explorer, navigate to your D2R install and Saved Games directories.</p>
<p>Right click the <code>mod</code> folder and <code>Reimagined</code> folder, select ‘compress to…’ and choose ZIP file. Rename the ZIP file to something memorable, and move it somewhere easy to remember (e.g. your desktop).</p>
<p>Remember to periodically create new ZIP folders so that you don't lose progress in case of crashes, exceeding your save file data limit, etc..<br>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Reimagined Desktop Launcher (BETA)</h2>
<p>Introducing the Reimagined Desktop Launcher (RDL) - a simple way to install, update, tweak and run the Reimagined mod!</p>
<p>RDL is a precursor solution to the official Reimagined Launcher, which is still in development.</p>
<p>The Reimagined Desktop Launcher was developed by Ultimate Supporter <mark class="pen-green"><strong>Slamina</strong></mark>.</p>
<p><strong>Any feedback, issues or suggestions, please speak to </strong><mark class="pen-green"><strong>Vinge</strong></mark><strong>.</strong></p>
<blockquote>
  <p><mark class="pen-red"><strong>D2RMM Users: RDL makes changes to mod files in your D2R install directory (above) - you will need to copy the ‘advanced’ and ‘data’ folders to D2RMM\mods\Reimagined for them to work.</strong></mark></p>
</blockquote>
<h3>Download the Reimagined Desktop Launcher</h3>
<blockquote>
  <p>Download Links:<br><a href="/reimagined_desktop_launcher_v2(beta).zip">/reimagined_desktop_launcher_v2(beta).zip</a><br><a href="/advanced_tweaks.zip">/advanced_tweaks.zip</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Download and unzip 'Reimagined Desktop Launcher v2(BETA).zip' onto your <code>Desktop</code>.</p>
<ul>
  <li>In the RDL folder you'll see a number of files and folders, and a ReadMe.txt.</li>
  <li><i>This download includes 7zr.exe, which is used to extract Reimagined 7z files from Nexus.</i></li>
</ul>
<p>For additional changes, download and unzip ‘advanced tweaks.zip’.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Copy the <code>mods</code> folder inside and paste it in your D2R install directory (see above for location). This should merge the contents with the existing folder.<br>&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<h3>Installing &amp; Updating Reimagined</h3>
<blockquote>
  <p><mark class="pen-red"><strong>These steps assume you have already&nbsp;downloaded and unpacked the Reimagined Desktop Launcher (see above)</strong></mark></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Follow these steps to install and/or update Reimagined to the latest version:</p>
<p>1. Download the latest version of Reimagined from Nexus Mods.</p>
<p>2. Move the downloaded .7z file from your <code>Downloads</code>&nbsp;folder to the <code>Reimagined Desktop Launcher/7zr</code> folder.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Delete any previous .7z files from this folder.</li>
</ul>
<p>3. In the <code>Reimagined Desktop Launcher</code> folder, double-click ‘Install Reimagined (Install-Update)’.</p>
<ul>
  <li><mark class="pen-red"><strong>Note: this performs a fresh install of Reimagined. Any changes you've made, whether manually or the Advanced Tweaks below, will be wiped and need&nbsp;to be remade.</strong></mark></li>
  <li>If you see a warning press ‘More Info’ and click ‘Run Anyway’.</li>
  <li>You should see a black command window open - let the process finish.<ul>
      <li>If you see an error, refer to the troubleshooting section below.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>
<p>4. The mod is now installed/updated and ready to play!<br>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Play &amp; Backup</h3>
<p>To play the mod, double-click either of the ‘Play Reimagined’ files.</p>
<ul>
  <li>‘Play Reimagined (Daily Backup)’ - Launches the game and creates a backup of your Reimagined Saved Game files with today's date. If a backup exists from today, it will overwrite it.</li>
  <li>‘Play Reimagined (Session Backup)’ - Launches the game and creates a backup of your Reimagined Saved Game files each time you launch the game, including the date/time.</li>
</ul>
<p>Backup files are located under your <code>Saved Games</code> folder, in a folder called <code>Reimagined Automatic Saved Game Backups</code> - see File Locations above.<br>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Advanced Tweaks</h3>
<p>In addition to installing and updating the mod, you can use the RDL to make additional changes.</p>
<p>Navigate to the <code>Advanced</code> folder - here you should see a number of files.</p>
<p>To <mark class="pen-green"><strong>install</strong></mark> changes, simply double-click the relevant file(s).</p>
<p>To <mark class="pen-red"><strong>uninstall </strong></mark>changes simply re-run ‘Install Reimagined (Install-Update)’.</p>
<p>As mentioned above, whenever you run ‘Install Reimagined (Install-Update)’ any manual or advanced tweaks changes will need to be redone.<br>&nbsp;</p>

<h2><br>D2RMM</h2>
<p><a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/diablo2resurrected/mods/169">D2RMM on Nexus Mods</a></p>
<p>Using a Mod Manager allows you to easily install a variety of mods together (assuming they play nice) without having to know anything about modding.</p>
<p>Your mod files will be now be located in <code><strong>D2RMM\mods\</strong></code><strong> </strong>instead of <code><strong>Diablo II Resurrected\mods\</strong></code>.</p>
<p>Any changes you make to Reimagined<strong> </strong>files needs to be done in the D2RMM mods directory.</p>
<h3><br>Reimagined Features:</h3>
<p>Reimagined is packed full of expansive features and QOL updates, so installing extra mods isn't always necessary.</p>
<p>If you have questions about whether something is included in Reimagined, or would like to see something added, DM one of the Devs, or post in the suggestions-and-feedback channel of our discord channel.</p>
<p>A number of Mod Creators gave express permission to include their mod in Reimagined. Where this is the case credit is given on the <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/diablo2resurrected/mods/503?tab=description">Reimagined Nexus Mods</a> page.</p>

<h2>Loot Filters</h2>
<blockquote>
  <p><mark class="pen-red"><strong>This guide assumes you have already downloaded and installed D2RMM (see above)</strong></mark></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
  <p><mark class="pen-red"><strong>If you find Quilted Armor with no graphics, leave them on the ground. Do not attempt to identify or sell them.</strong></mark></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Reimagined doesn't yet include a built-in Loot Filter.</p>
<p>One of the most popular reasons to use a Mod Manager is to install a 3rd-party Loot Filter to help reduce clutter.</p>
<p>Below we'll take you through a step-by-step guide on how to install and configure a loot filter. We recommend <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/diablo2resurrected/mods/467">Pseudo Loot Filter</a>.<br>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>File Steps</h4>
<p>1. Open your <code>D2RMM</code> folder and navigate to the <code>mods</code> directory</p>
<ul>
  <li>You should see a text file called 'PUT YOUR MODS HERE' - leave this window open, we'll use it later</li>
</ul>
<p>2. Open a new File Explorer window and navigate to your <code>Reimagined</code> mod folder</p>
<p>3. Copy the <code>Reimagined.mpq</code> folder (this should contain Data and ModInfo.json)</p>
<p>4. Paste the <code>Reimagined.mpq</code> folder into the <code>D2RMM/mods</code> folder from step 2</p>
<ul>
  <li>Feel free to rename Reimagined.mpq to something that makes more sense to you (e.g. Reimagined)</li>
</ul>
<h4>D2RMM Steps</h4>
<p>5. Open D2RMM as Administrator. Once open, click the three dots in the bottom-right corner and select 'Refresh Mod List'</p>
<p>6. Reimagined.mpq should appear in the mod list (or whatever you renamed the folder to)</p>
<blockquote>
  <p><mark class="pen-red"><strong>The Reimagined folder must always be first in the list of mods. Click and drag the line to the top if it isn't.</strong></mark></p>
</blockquote>
<p>7. Navigate to the Settings tab (at the top)</p>
<ul>
  <li>7a. Click on General<ul>
      <li>Change 'Output Mod Name' to 'Reimagined'</li>
      <li>Toggle 'Automatically install mods before running the game'</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>7b. Click on Game Launcher<ul>
      <li>Under 'Extra Game Args', paste the following: -mod Reimagined -txt</li>
      <li>Feel free to add any other args you want here</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>
<p>8. Navigate back to the Mods tab</p>
<p>9. Click Install Mods</p>
<h4><br>Save File Steps</h4>
<p>10. In File Explorer, navigate to your <code>Saved Games</code> directory</p>
<p>11. Check the <code>Reimagined</code> folder - if you see your save files, you're good to go!&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
  <li>If the folder is empty, copy the contents from the backup folder you created earlier, and paste the contents in the empty Reimagined folder.<br>&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<h4>Final step</h4>
<p>12. Hit 'Run D2R' in D2RMM and have fun!</p>
<h4><br>FAQ:</h4>
<p>My mod isn't showing up in the mod list on D2RMM?</p>
<ol>
  <li>Either you didn't put the Reimagined.mpq folder in D2RMM/mods or it's in a sub-folder called Reimagined</li>
  <li>Run D2RMM as administrator</li>
  <li>You may need to follow step 8 to update the Output Mod Name</li>
</ol>
<p>DM on discord if you need further instructions/help</p>
