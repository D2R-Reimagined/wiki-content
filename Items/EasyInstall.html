<h1>Reimagined Installer</h1>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This Reimagined Installer is very simple to use. &nbsp;You download the latest version of Reimagined off of Nexus &amp; save it into this Reimagined Installer folder. &nbsp;Then you run the bat file and now your mod is installed. &nbsp;If you already have reimagined installed, this will overwrite your install &amp; update the mod. &nbsp;No 3rd party software will need to be installed, but a freeware commandline tool will need to be downloaded once. &nbsp;This makes updating your Reimagined fast &amp; easy! &nbsp;Instructions are included in the readme file inside the zip.</p>

<h2><u>How the Reimagined Installer works</u></h2>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>There is a bat file along with a readme instruction included inside the zip. &nbsp;A freeware command line version of 7zip will need to be downloaded as mentioned inside the readme. &nbsp;This version of 7zip does not install itself onto your system. &nbsp;This installer should never needs to be redownloaded. &nbsp;It's purpose is to simply make uncompressing future reimagined downloads even easier. &nbsp;No longer need any installed software to uncompress the Reimagined mod.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><u>EASY INSTRUCTIONS</u></h2>
<p>1. Navigate to your \Diablo II Resurrected\</p>
<p>2. Unzip the file dragging the Mods folder into an empty space merging it with the existing Mods folder. &nbsp;Now you'll have a new folder in:&nbsp;</p>
<p>\Diablo II Resurrected\Mods\Reimagined Installer &nbsp;</p>
<p>3. Download the latest version of Reimagined off Nexus &amp; save that large .7z file into that new folder listed above.</p>
<p>4. Finally doubleclick the bat file &amp; the reimagined mod will be uncompressed and overwrite your old mod. &nbsp;Your saved games are located in a different location and should remain safe when updating the mod. &nbsp;This will work if it's your first time installing Reimagined or if you simply want to update your existing installation with a new version.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Now Reimagined is installed!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Bat files are fully transparent &amp; editable by right clicking and choosing edit with notepad. &nbsp;A bat file is simply Microsoft Windows Command Prompt executing commands one after another. &nbsp;</p>
