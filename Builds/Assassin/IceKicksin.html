<p>Here's my current kicksin build. I haven't even upgraded any equipment yet, just using some standard uniques that are pretty easy to get hold of.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span class="text-big"><strong><u>SKILLS:</u></strong></span><br><strong><u>Traps:&nbsp;</u></strong><br>NONE</p>
<p><strong><u>Shadow Disciplines:</u></strong><br>Claw Mastery - 1<br>Weapon Block - 1<br>Burst of Speed - 1<br>Fade - (item bonuses only)</p>
<p><strong><u>Martial Arts:</u></strong><br>Dragon Talon - 1<br>Dragon Claw - 1<br>Dragon Tail - 25<br>Tiger Strike - 25<br>Cobra Strike - 1<br>Fists of Fire - 1<br>Claws of Thunder - 1<br>Blades of Ice - 25<br><br>I'm currently level 97 with 25 skill points left over. You can do whatever you want with them.</p>
<p><span class="text-big"><strong><u>STATS:</u></strong></span><br>Strength: 250 base, 380 with gear<br>Dexterity: 80 base, 202 with gear<br>Vitality: 225 base, 306 with gear<br>Energy: 25 base, 73 with gear<br>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Kick damage scales more with strength than it does with dexterity, so don't hesitate to invest a LOT into strength, not just to equip heavy gear, but I found at lvl 97, each 5 points of strength increases my dragon tail damage by about 1k.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>GEAR:<br>Helm: Andariel's Visage Demonhead [E] - 4 sockets - cham rune, 3 +1 skill jewels<br>You mainly want this for +skills and IAS/lifesteal</p>
<p><strong><u>Necklace</u></strong>: rare amulet with +2 assassin skills and +max all resist<br>It's been my experience that if you want to play in Players8 Hell, you need more than the standard 75 max resist. I'm currently at 81 max, but 90+ is what you should aim for.</p>
<p><strong><u>Chest</u></strong>: Shadowtrick Shadow Plate [E] - 4 sockets - RAL (+30 fire resist) - JAH (+5% max HP) - 2x UM (+15 all resist each)<br>Doesn't get much better than this. Dragon tail does physical AND fire damage, plus blades of ice ovbiously does cold damage. Having Conviction, even at a low level, is really helpful. Plus having Teleport, Shout, and Battle Orders really upgrades your survivability</p>
<p><strong><u>Weapons</u></strong>: 2x Skaadi's Claws Runic Talons [E]<br>Despite weapons not transferring many effects to Dragon Tail, these are essential because of “50% chance to not consume charges on finishing move”. With two of them, you can continuously kick (kicks also refresh your charges) as long as you want. Add in Frozen Armor for more survivability, and Cold Mastery to reduce enemy cold resist, these are the best choice. You can also switch one or both for Mosaic. Not as effective, but still great.</p>
<p><strong><u>Belt</u></strong>: Assassin Vine Battle Belt [X] upgraded to Troll Belt [E]. +1 assassin skills, +kick damage, and a huge bump in strength make this the ONLY choice that I'm aware of.</p>
<p><strong><u>Rings</u></strong>: use whatever rings you have lying around to fill out resistances, but try to get some +all skills on them. I have 2 rare rings, only 1 of them has +1 to all skills.</p>
<p><strong><u>Gloves</u></strong>: Dracul's Grasp Vampirebone Gloves [E]<br>These are a wonderful source of casting life tap. It seems like at the end-game, life tap is your only way to stay alive, because you can't count on life leech to work on all monsters.</p>
<p><strong><u>Boots</u></strong>: Wild Horse Myrmidon Greaves [E]<br>These are the main source of damage in a kicking build, because damage comes from your boots, not your weapons. These have +kick damage as well as add a good chunk of +str and +dex.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><u>Charms</u></strong>:<br><strong>Normal Torch</strong> - +skills, +all attributes, +all resist (upgrade it if you want to spend all that extra time, if you think it's worth it)&nbsp;<br><strong>Black Soulstone</strong> - +skills, +all attributes +all resist<br><strong>Queen's Call Grand Charm</strong> - +skills, +all resist, +life (note: I <i>don't think</i> faster block rate affects Weapon Block)<br><strong>Life &amp; Dealth Large Charm</strong> - +skills<br><strong>4x Cataclysmic Large Charm</strong> (magic) - minus 5% enemy fire resist each<br><strong>Web of Wyrd Grand Charm</strong> - +vitaility, +8% max life, +8% physical damage reduction (note I <i>know</i> increased block chance doesn't affect Weapon Block)<br><strong>upgraded Fire Sunder Grand Charm</strong><br><strong>upgraded Physical Sunder Grand Charm</strong><br><strong>3x skill grand charms </strong>(magic) - right now I only have 1 that does + martial arts, the other two are + shadow disciplines, which isn't optimal<br><strong>Nightshade Grand Charm</strong> - faster run/walk, a bit of life, and freezes enemies. This one doesn't really matter anymore, I'll probably replace it soon<br><br><span class="text-big"><strong><u>Basic play style</u></strong>:</span><br>Step 1: Apply buffs (frozen armor, burst of speed, shout, and battle orders)<br>Step 2: Teleport to find a group of enemies<br>Step 3: get 3 stacks of Tiger Strike, then 3 stacks of Cobra Strike, then 3 stacks of Blades of Ice<br>Step 4: Dragon Tail until everything is obliterated</p>
<p>Currently with all stacks applied, my Dragon Tail does 97,000-140,000, which kills most mobs in 1-3 kicks. Monsters that are resistant to physical or fire will take substantially longer, as it is the main weakness of this build. That's why I chose to add in Blades of Ice for those select few. Also, shattering enemies is nice, because it leaves less mess on the ground. But even for fire/phys resistant monsters, since the kick has a knockback effect, you can pretty easily stun-lock most enemies if they take a while to kill.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;</p>
