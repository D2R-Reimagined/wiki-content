# Upgrading the Quality of your Armor or Weapon	

I would like to showcase the importance of the quality on items in this game, review some ways you can upgrade these with cube recipes and cover the main scenarios where upgrading armor or weapons can result in a significantly stronger player or mercenary.  Finally at the very bottom of this page I wanted to share some pictures of the upgrade results so you can see the difference with a few weapons along with a piece of armor.  

**WARNING:** *Take special note of the level, strength & dexterity requirements as they will increase when you upgrade them!  Upgrading a weapon while you're leveling is a great idea if you have two identical weapons, so if the level requirements are too high you can continue with your non-upgraded weapon.*

## Quality types explained
[N] = Normal
[X] = Exceptional
[E] = Elite (*best*)

There are three different quality tiers with [N] having the lowest level requirements along with the lowest defense on armor & weakest damage on weapons.  With [E] having the highest level requirements along with the highest defense on armor & highest damage on weapons.  In this mod these abbreviated letters allow you to know the quality of all items.

It's important to note that even in the [E] Elite category, not all armor and weapons are equal.  If you are creating a runeword, it's important to take note of the str & dex requirements when picking a base.  While you can grab any random white chest piece you find to add sockets, a barbarian class should strive to find the highest Defense possible which is the [E] Sacred Armor.

There are specific 1H, 2H and ranged weapons that have higher damage then others that scale exceptionally well with the Enhanced Damage % modifier.  While Blizzard typically sets these as a slower attack speed base, in the Reimagined mod there are addstats/charms/jewels/runes to assist with Increased Attack Speed breakpoints.  Finding a significantly high Enhanced Damage % on a weaker base is fine while you're leveling, but **for end game the goal should be using a runeword or end-game-crafting with the highest damage ranged base your class can equip.**

## When to pick a particular Armor or Weapon type

When you are making a runeword you'll be keeping for a long time. (especially weapons)
When you have an Orb of Conversion & want a **chance at getting a certain unique item**.
When you have an Orb of Assemblage & want a **chance at getting a certain set item**.
When you have an Orb of Infusion & want the best rare, picking the best item is key.
When you are crafting a weapon or armor using a unique jewel + high runes.

Here is an example, let's say you have a chest piece of armor where the base has 200 defense, if it has +200% Enhanced Defense from a runeword then it would have 600 defense.  If you had a chest piece of armor where the base has 500 defense, then the +200% Enhanced Defense from a runeword then it would have 1500 defense!  This becomes extremely important for physical damage classes when picking a weapon as damage scales from the base too.  Forcing armor or weapons to become Ethereal using the orb or recipe gives a bonus to the base further making it important to pick a great base.


## What is possible in Reimagined
You can upgrade a rare, set or unique from [N] to [X]
You can upgrade a rare, set or unique from [X] to [E]

You can change a grey or magic item to white with the HEL+EL recipe
Next you can change that white item to rare with an Orb of Infusion, allowing [X] or [E] upgrades.

Using the gambling system in-game, players can obtain any specific item and rather quickly upgrade the base to the exact item you want.  Force it to white, punch the specific sockets needed for a runeword using magic jewels.  Or force it rare to be used with an orb at a chance of becoming a specific unique or set piece.  The end game crafting recipes hold exceptional power, but due to their high cost worth of ingredients, put extra thought into the base you want to use as that is used for the randomized crafted armor or weapon.

## Example of how to get a specific base for Orb of Conversion usage
Let's pretend you found an "Orb of Conversion" & you wanted a chance at getting the "Tarrasque Hide" unique chestpiece.  I will walk through the steps I typically take and add some pictures along the way.

First we lookup the stats on the reimagined website for this particular unique armor, here in the picture we see that the base is a "Boneweave" armor.
![boneweave1.jpg](/qualityupgrading/boneweave1.jpg)
There are different websites you can visit, but the one I typically go to is here where I'll find the "Armor" or "Weapons" sections. https://www.purediablo.com/diablo-2

Since we are looking for a Boneweave chest armor, I will click on "Body Armor" on the website.
https://www.purediablo.com/diablo-2/diablo-2-body-armor

Here is a screnshot from the website:
![boneweaver2.jpg](/qualityupgrading/boneweaver2.jpg)
As seen in the picture above, there are 15 different chest armors in each of the N, X & E categories.

So we look for the "Boneweave" and realize it is an Elite [E] item.  The website shows it as 4.8 on the list.  If we click on the name we can see the picture of the base in-game as seen in this next picture.
![boneweaver3.jpg](/qualityupgrading/boneweaver3.jpg)
Now going back to the list instead of clicking on 4.8 we will click on 2.8 which is "Chain Mail".  This is the Normal [N] version of this exact same armor, you can see the graphic is identical as well making it easier to spot when trying to gamble for items too.  So with this information, heading in-game to a gambling vendor you can simply gamble for a "Chain Mail" until you get a blue magic [E] version which you can HEL+EL to white, then force to rare with an Orb of Infusion.  Or you can gamble until you happen to find  any quality of a rare & then upgrade that to [X] or [E].
![boneweaver4.jpg](/qualityupgrading/boneweaver4.jpg)
To be clear, when gambling from the vendor for a "Chain Mail" specifically you will always randomly be getting one of these three versions of quality of this item:
[N] = Chain Mail
[X] = Mesh Armor
[E] = Boneweave

The website shows there are only two unique Boneweave armors, however due to rarity weighting it is not a 50% chance at either chestpiece when using an Orb of Conversion.  While you could spend hours or days hunting for a specific base item on the ground to use, forcing one by gambling for use with your orbs or crafting needs is the faster way to go about it!

Weapons are the same way, three different versions of the same weapon.  Once you understand the system & how the in-game graphic is the same on all 3 versions, it makes getting the base you're looking for rather easy & fast!

# Upgrading your gear to [X] or [E] while leveling can make a huge difference
Here are a few examples for a Barbarian and for an Act2 Mercenary while leveling.  This shows how the Enhanced Damage % on a weapon scales directly with the base.  So enormous changes in your damage output occurs when upgrading a physical damage weapon!  But be very cautious as different items have different level requirements as well.

One of the best times to increase the base quality of a weapon or chest armor while you are leveling is when you find two of the same uniques or set items.  So if you have two identical unique weapons, you could upgrade one of them from [N] to [X] and the level requirements might only increase by 3  where you're able to use it right away.  Or perhaps it increases the level requirements by +15 & it is unusable!  Not to worry as you have a second weapon & can keep this ready to use once you get to that level.  The pictures show how powerful the reimagination base upgrades are!

Here is a low level 2H spear I upgraded while leveling, showing the Mercenary's character screen.  Note the large damage difference between the two quality versions.

![slamweaponcompare.jpg](/qualityupgrading/slamweaponcompare.jpg)
Here is the new 2.0 Barbarian "Techtonic Slam" on the character screen at level 25.  This unique drops at a [N] quality by default, however upgrading it to [X] happens to not increase the required level & delivers significantly more damage!  2H Mace bases are some of the highest damage bases, making this particular unique extra strong for early leveling.

## While leveling the primary three items to upgrade are:
Your 1H 2H or Bow!  Not only will you do significantly more damage, the [X] or [E] versions might allow for more sockets when you use an Orb of Socketing.

Your Chest Armor!  Not only will your overall defense climb significantly higher, the [X] or [E] versions might allow for upto 4 sockets when you use an Orb of Socketing.

Your Helmet!  The typical diablo2 websites show many helmets do not allow for 4 sockets, however in Reimagined most of the [E] Elite helmets have been changed to allow for upto 4 sockets.

## Examples with more pictures of weapons & armor
Finally I wanted to include a few more pictures showing the [N] [X] [E] versions of various weapons and armor and how incredible taking advantage of the Reimagined upgrade recipes are.  Included an Ethereal weapon in a picture too.  

Click on "Cube Recipes" on the left to access the Rare or set/unique recipes to change items to [X] or [E].
