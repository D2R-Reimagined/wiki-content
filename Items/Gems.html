<h2>Gems</h2>
<p>All gems now have a single quality level - vanilla qualities (e.g. chipped, flawed, normal, flawless, perfect) have been removed.</p>
<p>All gems drop from Act 2, Arcane Sanctuary onwards and require level 18 to use.</p>

<h2>Gem Storage: The Gem Bag</h2>
<p>All new characters start with a Gem Bag in their inventory, and replacements can be purchased from vendors should you somehow misplace it.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>How it works</h2>
<p>The Gem Bag is used to store large numbers of gems, and uses a "credit" system. Each gem added to the bag adds one credit that can be used to retrieve any of the seven gem types.&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Storing Gems</h2>
<p>Transmute up to 99 assorted gems with the Gem Bag to store them. The Gem Bag itself can hold up to 65,000 gems!</p>

<h2>Retrieving Gems</h2>
<p>Gems can be retrieved using ‘grabbers’ (also purchased from vendors).</p>
<h2>Gem Recipes</h2>
<p>The Gem Bag can be used as a Gem reagent for crafting recipes that create a new item (as long as you have enough gems stored). This includes recipes that reroll or recycle items:</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">e.g. REROLL CHARM - Gem Bag (3 Gems) + Magic&nbsp;Grand Charm = New Magic&nbsp;Grand Charm (100% plvl)</p>
<p>If a recipe requires gems to modify an existing item then gems need to be used instead of the bag:</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">&nbsp;e.g. ADD ITEM STAT - Amulet &amp; 9 Emeralds = +1 to Druid Skills</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
