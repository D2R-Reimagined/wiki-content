<p>Mod Install Location*: <code>&lt;drive&gt;\Program Files (x86)\Diablo II Resurrected\mods</code></p>
<p>Character Save File Location*: <code>&lt;drive&gt;\Users\&lt;your user&gt;\Saved Games\Diablo II Resurrected\mods</code>&nbsp;</p>
<p>*Your directory structure may differ depending on where you chose to install the game and your save files.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Version Compatibility</h4>
<p>Major patch versions (e.g. 1.X → 2.X) often have changes that may make character saves incompatible.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The description on Nexus Mods and associated patch notes will tell you when save-breaking changes are introduced.</p>
<p><mark class="pen-red">We strongly suggest making a backup of your Mod folder and Character Save folders before updating the mod, even between minor patches.</mark></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4><strong>Updating from 1.x to 2.x</strong></h4>
<ol>
  <li>Download the zip from Nexus Mods.</li>
  <li>Extract the files into the <code>mods</code> directory of your D2R install. This should create a new folder called <code>Reimagined</code>.</li>
  <li>Copy your 1.X shortcut - rename it appropriately so you know which shortcut is which.</li>
  <li>Open the properties of your new shortcut. Change <code>-mod <strong>Merged</strong> -txt</code> → <code>-mod <strong>Reimagined</strong> -txt</code></li>
  <li>Launch the game using the new shortcut.</li>
</ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4><strong>Updating within the same major version (1.x -&gt; 1.y)</strong></h4>
<p>When updating to the latest version of D2R Reimagined from a previous version:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Download the Latest Version from Nexus Mods.</li>
  <li>Make a backup of your <code>Merged</code> folder in your <code>mods</code> directory.</li>
  <li>Delete the <code>Merged</code> folder in your <code>mods</code> directory.</li>
  <li>Extract the new version into the <code>mods</code> directory.</li>
</ol>
<p><br><strong>Why do we delete the entire folder?</strong></p>
<p>Sometimes the mod will delete files and if you simply extract over without deleting those files will still exist and could cause issues.</p>
<p><strong>Will my saves be okay?</strong></p>
<p>Unless explicitly expressed in the patch notes that a new save is required your saves are safe.</p>
