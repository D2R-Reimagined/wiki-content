<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><strong>Characters</strong></h2>
<p>- Skills cap out at 25 hard points, up from 20.</p>
<p>- Many skills and their synergies have been changed - you can see a summary of these changes in-game by pressing Escape and looking at the Class Balancing section.</p>
<p>- You can respec at any time by cubing a TP Scroll and an ID Scroll in the cube to give you a token of absolution.</p>
<p><br>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><strong>Items</strong></h2>
<p>- Check the <a href="https://www.d2r-reimagined.com/">website</a> pages to find items. - Note: Some <strong>Set</strong> Names haven't been added fully. Find the items you want by doing a page search (Ctrl + F).</p>
<p>- Stacked Items: Runes drop as 'stacks' (the + sign in the top-left is a visual indicator), which can store up to 100 in a stack. Cube a stack to create a rune stack with qty=1. Cube a stack of qty=1 to revert it to a non-stacked state to use it as normal.</p>
<p>- Retrieve socketed items: Item + TP Scroll, returns all socketed gems/jewels/runes. - Pro Tip: can be used to endlessly re-roll <a href="https://d2rr.wiki.gg/wiki/Runewords">Runewords</a>!</p>
<p>- Re-roll Items into White Bases: Item + Hel Rune + El Rune, re-rolls the item as a white base with new affixes</p>
<p>- Item Augmentation: Check the <a href="https://d2rr.wiki.gg/wiki/AddItemStats">Add Item Stat Recipes</a> page</p>
<p>- Crafting: Check the <a href="https://d2rr.wiki.gg/wiki/Crafting">Item Crafting</a> about how to craft and alter various items</p>
<p>- Essence drops have been replaced by <a href="https://d2rr.wiki.gg/wiki/Orbs#Orb_of_Socketing">Socketing orbs</a>.</p>
<p>- Many new Runewords have been added - while you level keep checking the runeword page on the website for new and exciting options for your build!</p>
<p>- Jewels can be used to 'socket-punch' items when you want a specific number of sockets (as long as the item supports it). Item Rarity = Jewel Rarity required to punch sockets with. * Note that number of open sockets is dependent on the ilvl of the item. Check <a href="https://maxroll.gg/d2/items/sockets">https://maxroll.gg/d2/items/sockets</a> under 'Item Sockets By ilvl' for details.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><strong>Quality of Life</strong></h2>
<p>- Cube a rune with ID Tomb to cube a rune down.&nbsp;<br>- Cube Two of the same rune with a TP Tomb to cube a rune up.</p>
<p>- <a href="https://d2rr.wiki.gg/wiki/Runes">Runes</a> and <a href="https://d2rr.wiki.gg/wiki/Gems">Gems</a> can be stacked for better inventory management - cube three single runes or gems together to form a new stack.</p>
<p>- You can store all your <a href="https://d2rr.wiki.gg/wiki/Gems">Gems</a> in a gem bag, which is created by cubing all 7 gems together.&nbsp;</p>
<p>-Gem Grabbers are used to retrieve gems from the bag. Gem Grabbers can be purchased from most vendors. You can cycle Gem Grabbers by cubing them by themselves to choose which gem type you would like to extract.</p>
<p>- Keys can be stored in a Keychain, and extracted with the appropriate key grabber. Grabbers can be found at many vendors.</p>
<figure class="image"><img src="/keychain_3.png"></figure>
<p>- There is a charm (<a href="https://d2rr.wiki.gg/wiki/Charms">Collin's Might</a>) that allows your melee attacks to have splash damage that drops from Corpsefire in the Den of Evil on normal (once per character). It can be upgraded a number of times via cube recipes to deal more damage and have less penalties.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><mark class="pen-red"><strong>Due to character file size limitations in place by D2R it is recommended to keep STACKED ITEMS, KEYCHAINS, and GEM BAGS in a SHARED STASH TAB to prevent items from disappearing.</strong></mark></p>
