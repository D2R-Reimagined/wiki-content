<h1>Installation Guides</h1>
<p>Below is a compilation of useful information and guides.</p>
<h3>File Locations</h3>
<blockquote>
  <p><i><mark class="pen-red"><strong>C: Drive is the most common install location. Yours may differ depending on your setup.</strong></mark></i></p>
  <p><mark class="pen-green"><strong>D2R Mod Files:</strong></mark> <code>C:\Program Files (x86)\Diablo II Resurrected\mods\Reimagined</code></p>
  <p><i><mark class="pen-green"><strong>Saved Game Files:</strong></mark> </i><code><i>C:\Users\</i>%USERPROFILE%<i>\Saved Games\Diablo II Resurrected\mods\Reimagined</i></code></p>
</blockquote>
<h3>Making Backups (Manual Steps)</h3>
<p>In File Explorer, navigate to your D2R install and Saved Games directories.</p>
<p>Right click the <code>mod</code> folder and <code>Reimagined</code> folder, select ‘compress to…’ and choose ZIP file. Rename the ZIP file to something memorable, and move it somewhere easy to remember (e.g. your desktop).</p>
<p>Remember to periodically create new ZIP folders so that you don't lose progress in case of crashes, exceeding your save file data limit, etc..<br>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Reimagined BETA Launcher</h2>
<p>Introducing the Reimagined BETA Launcher - a simple way to install, update, tweak and run the Reimagined mod!</p>
<p>The BETA Launcher is a precursor solution to the official Reimagined Launcher, which is still in development.</p>
<p>The Reimagined BETA Launcher was originally conceived by <mark class="pen-green"><strong>Slamina</strong></mark>.</p>
<p><strong>Any feedback, issues or suggestions, please speak to </strong><mark class="pen-green"><strong>Vinge</strong></mark><strong>.</strong><br>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Download the Reimagined BETA Launcher</h3>
<blockquote>
  <p>Download Link: <a href="/reimagined_beta_launcher.zip">Reimagined BETA Launcher</a></p>
  <p><mark class="pen-green"><strong>Requires an official Diablo II: Resurrected install to work.</strong></mark></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Download and extract the <mark class="pen-green"><strong>Reimagined BETA Launcher</strong></mark>. We suggest keeping the folder in an easy-to-remember location, such as your desktop.</p>
<ul>
  <li><i>The launcher includes executables that are used by files to perform their various functions. These can be found in the </i><code><i>utils</i></code><i> directory. Nothing is installed on your PC.</i></li>
</ul>
<p>If anything isn't working please post in the <code>installation-help</code> channel on discord.<br>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Installing &amp; Updating Reimagined</h3>
<blockquote>
  <p><mark class="pen-green"><strong>Your Save Game files are unaffected by these steps.</strong></mark></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Follow these steps to install and/or update Reimagined to the latest version:</p>
<p><mark class="pen-green"><strong>1. </strong></mark>Download the latest version of Reimagined from <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/diablo2resurrected/mods/503?tab=description">Nexus Mods</a> - this can take a few minutes.</p>
<p><mark class="pen-green"><strong>2.</strong></mark> Move the downloaded .7z file from your <code>Downloads</code>&nbsp;folder to the <code>Reimagined BETA Launcher</code> folder.</p>
<p><mark class="pen-green"><strong>3.</strong></mark> Run the launcher.</p>
<ul>
  <li>If you see a warning from Windows Defender, press ‘More Info’ and click ‘Run Anyway’.</li>
</ul>
<p><mark class="pen-green"><strong>4. </strong></mark>Select <code>Install / Update</code>. The mod is now installed/updated and ready to play!</p>
<blockquote>
  <p><mark class="pen-red"><strong>D2RMM Users: The BETA launcher makes changes to mod files in your D2R install directory (above) - you will need to copy the ‘data’ folder to D2RMM\mods\Reimagined for updates to work.</strong></mark></p>
</blockquote>
<h3>Play &amp; Backup</h3>
<p>The BETA Launcher will automatically back up your save files on launch with today's date and time.</p>
<p>You can make additional backups, and find/open the backup folder under the <code>Backup Save Files</code> menu.<br>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Additional Modifications</h3>
<p>In addition to installing and updating the mod, you can use the BETA Launcher to install pre-packaged changes.</p>
<p>To <mark class="pen-green"><strong>install</strong></mark> changes visit the <code>Configuration Menu</code> and follow the prompts.</p>
<p>To <mark class="pen-red"><strong>uninstall </strong></mark>changes simply re-run <code>Install / Update</code> from the Main Menu.</p>
<p>As mentioned above, whenever you install or update the mod any modifications you've made (whether manually or via the Launcher) will need to be redone.</p>
<p>If you encounter any issues, please post in the <code>installation-help</code> channel on discord.</p>
<h2><br>D2RMM</h2>
<p>Using a Mod Manager allows you to easily install a variety of mods together (assuming they play nice) without having to know anything about modding.</p>
<p>Reimagined is packed full of expansive features and QOL updates, so installing extra mods isn't always necessary.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Check the list of <a href="https://wiki.d2r-reimagined.com/en/Installs#reimagined-features">Reimagined features</a> below to see if a 3rd-party mod is still necessary.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When using D2RMM your active mod files will be now be located under the <code><strong>D2RMM\mods\</strong></code><strong> </strong>folder instead of <code><strong>Diablo II Resurrected\mods\</strong></code>.</p>
<p>Any changes you make to Reimagined files needs to be done in the D2RMM mods directory.</p>
<p>If using the RDL (above), you will need to copy the file changes over from <code><strong>Diablo II Resurrected\mods\Reimagined\Reimagined.mpq\</strong></code> to <code><strong>D2RMM\mods\Reimagined\</strong></code>.<br>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>File Steps</h4>
<p>1. Download <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/diablo2resurrected/mods/169">D2RMM </a>from Nexus Mods.</p>
<p>2. Open the <code>D2RMM</code> folder - navigate to the <code>mods</code> directory.</p>
<ul>
  <li>You should see a text file called 'PUT YOUR MODS HERE' - leave this window open, we'll use it later.</li>
</ul>
<p>3. Open a new File Explorer window and navigate to your <code>Reimagined</code> mod folder under your D2R Install directory.</p>
<p>4. Copy the <code>Reimagined.mpq</code> folder (this should contain a Data folder and ModInfo.json).</p>
<p>5. Paste the <code>Reimagined.mpq</code> folder into the <code>D2RMM/mods</code> folder from step 2.</p>
<ul>
  <li>We recommend renaming the folder to <code>Reimagined</code></li>
</ul>
<h4>D2RMM Steps</h4>
<p>6. Open D2RMM as Administrator.</p>
<p>7. Once open, click the three dots in the bottom-right corner and select 'Refresh Mod List'.</p>
<p>8. Reimagined should appear in the mod list - click the box on the left-side to enable it.</p>
<blockquote>
  <p><mark class="pen-red"><strong>The Reimagined folder must always be first in the list of mods. Click and drag the line to the top if it isn't.</strong></mark></p>
</blockquote>
<p>9. Navigate to the Settings tab (at the top).</p>
<ul>
  <li>9a. Click on General.<ul>
      <li>Change 'Output Mod Name' to 'Reimagined'.</li>
      <li>Toggle 'Automatically install mods before running the game'.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>9b. Click on Game Launcher.<ul>
      <li>Under 'Extra Game Args', paste the following: <code>-mod Reimagined -txt</code></li>
      <li>Feel free to add any other args you want after everything else.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>
<p>10. Navigate back to the Mods tab.</p>
<p>11. Click Install Mods.<br>&nbsp;</p>

<h2>Loot Filters</h2>
<blockquote>
  <p><mark class="pen-red"><strong>This guide assumes you have already downloaded and installed D2RMM (see above)</strong></mark></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
  <p><mark class="pen-red"><strong>If you find Quilted Armor with no graphics, leave them on the ground. Do not attempt to identify or sell them.</strong></mark></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Reimagined doesn't yet include a built-in Loot Filter.</p>
<p>Below we'll take you through a step-by-step guide on how to install and configure a loot filter. We recommend <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/diablo2resurrected/mods/467">Pseudo Loot Filter</a>.<br>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>File Steps</h4>
<p>1. Download <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/diablo2resurrected/mods/467?tab=files">Pseudo Loot Filter</a> from Nexus Mods.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Select ‘Mod manager download’ to automatically download and load the mod into D2RMM.</li>
  <li>Select ‘Manual download’ to download the mod to your <code>Downloads</code> folder - extract the mod into your <code>D2RMM/mods</code> folder.<br>&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<h4>D2RMM Steps</h4>
<p>2. In D2RMM, click the 3 dots in the bottom-right, and select ‘Refresh Mod List’.</p>
<p>3. You should now see Pseudo Loot Filter appear in the list of mods - click the box to the left to enable the mod.</p>
<p>4. To configure the loot filter, click ‘settings’ to the right.</p>
<p>5. All items are enabled by default (the slider is on the right-side) - clicking the slider DISABLES the item (this affects all rarities, white, magic, rare, set, unique).</p>
<ul>
  <li>Disabling an item simply means that when a disabled item would drop, the game chooses to drop nothing instead.</li>
  <li>Disabling items does not affect drop chances of other items.</li>
  <li>It may take a few runs to tweak this list to your liking.</li>
</ul>
<p>6. Once you've finished disabling undesirable items, click out of the menu.</p>
<p>7. Click ‘Install Mods’ in the bottom-right.</p>
<p>8. Hit ‘Run D2R’.</p>
<h4><br>D2RMM FAQ:</h4>
<p>My mod isn't showing up in the mod list on D2RMM?</p>
<ul>
  <li>You didn't put the mod in D2RMM/mods, you didn't unzip the file you downloaded, or it's in a folder that D2RMM doesn't understand</li>
  <li>Run D2RMM as administrator</li>
</ul>
<p>DM on discord if you need further instructions/help</p>
