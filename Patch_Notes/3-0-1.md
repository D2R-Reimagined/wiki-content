## Steam QoL & Mod UI
- Changed text in character select on top left to "Click if Red"
> Hope to find a better way to convey this eventually but for now this should help with people not seeing the "Play" button.
- Updated version texts to 3.0.1
- Added both pliers to materials tab for DLC stash tabs

## Misc
- Added some gold value back to skills on class-specifics (not a lot yet.)
- Added some Void back to gold on drops. (pickup radius is tiny and annoying.)
- Changed potion base healing to 1/3 instead of 1/4 for HP1 and HP2, and 1/2 instead of 1/3 for HP4
  - Same for MP1, 2, and 4.

## Warlock
#### Demonic Mastery
- Changed petmax to 1 + 1 per 7 levels up to 4 total demons.
> The overall design of Warlock having a small band of 'elite' demons is a theme to stick with instead of giving them just a blanket more amount going forward. After actual playthroughs/testing warlock minions the goal will be to rework or buff the minions to be more respectable in the aforementioned aspect instead of increasing the max further than this.
#### Summon Goat Demon
- Base damage in hell increased by 30%
#### Summon Tainted
- Tainted Fire Ball explosion radius up to 5 from 4
- Now receive -2% enemy fire resistance per level of Demonic Mastery, (Self-only, not aura.)
#### Apocalypse
- File reference cosmetic change

## Itemization and QoL for Sunders 
- Seperated Latent (PreCrafted) Sunders to their own base
- Added a 3 to 1 (Random element) Sunder Reroll Recipe
> Sunders already found will no longer work in recipes, but future Sunder charms will. They can also now drop multiple times in the same game to prevent bricks while using the reroll recipe, they would drop as magic instead of unique before from mobs and the cube.

## Uber Ancients Fight Fixed (Warlock DLC Fight/Content Only)
- Ancients now spawn and use skills and spawn minions properly
- They now drop their jewels which have been updated (See below)
- Statues now drop as they do in Vanilla with each boss preferring their specific statue but overlapping a bit with 2 others.
- TZ Shards added to loot and can now drop from all TZ blue and gold monsters.

## Bug Fixes
- Fix Standard of Heroes placement in stash
- Fix Warlock pet icons not showing properly
- Fix missing Chaos Onyx Grabber and Recipes
- Fix Sunder charm range rolls
- Fix multiple missing inventory sprites
- Fix TZ rotation back to 60 minutes
- Fix Sigil colors not showing on monsters and pets properly where applicable
- Fix Orb names to universal recognizable orange color.
- Fix amulet and ring unique reroll recipes to drop at 99 for now until Blizzard fixes plvl column.
- Fix sound sliders not respecting their individual settings, combat, voice, etc, in multiple instances.
- Fix Warlock mana potion value being double what it should.
