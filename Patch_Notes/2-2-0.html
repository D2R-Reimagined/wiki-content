<h1>Support for Warlock DLC + D2R 3.0</h1>
<blockquote>
  <p>This should bring full compatibility with D2R 3.0. We are still working out kinks related to it</p>
</blockquote>
<h1><strong>Itemization re-work will get its own wiki page or something</strong></h1>
<p>see <a href="https://github.com/D2R-Reimagined/d2r-reimagined-mod/pull/930"><u>#930</u></a></p>
<h1><strong>New unique charm and jewelry sprites</strong></h1>
<p>see <a href="https://github.com/D2R-Reimagined/d2r-reimagined-mod/pull/919"><u>#919</u></a><br>and <a href="https://github.com/D2R-Reimagined/d2r-reimagined-mod/pull/923"><u>#923</u></a></p>
<h1><strong>All skill icons reworked from scratch</strong></h1>
<p>see <a href="https://github.com/D2R-Reimagined/d2r-reimagined-mod/pull/944"><u>#944</u></a></p>
<h1><strong>Item upgrade system renamed to Enchantments</strong></h1>
<blockquote>
  <p>Item Upgrade as a name was flawed and confusing. It has been renamed "Enchantments" now.</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
  <li>Uber charms and other systems that need upgrades still say upgrades.</li>
</ul>
<h1><strong>Rarity of Unique rings/amulets/charms/jewels tweaked</strong></h1>
<blockquote>
  <p>The goal here is to reduce the rarity disparity that exists. A good example is the unique grand charm Nightshade had a rarity of 5 and all others were set to 1, so you almost always found Nightshade(this has been reduced to 2). The overall changes to rings means that items like SOJ will be slightly more common. Many chase items were left or reduced to 1 rarity, and adjustments to 1 rarity rings/amulets that did not fit there were bumped up.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
  <p>The jewel rarities had many at 1, and several at 5 which skewed the rolls. now there are a handful at 2 and the rest at one. Primarily the elemental jewels that did not have elemental pen are set to rarity 2. typical facets are left at rarity 1.</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
  <li>Unique Rings total rarity decreased from 121 to 95</li>
  <li>Unique Amulets total rarity decreased from 130 to 108</li>
  <li>Small charm total rarity decreased from 17 to 10</li>
  <li>Large charm total rarity decreased from 7 to 6</li>
  <li>Grand charm total rarity decreased from 10 to 7</li>
  <li>Unique jewels total rarity decreased from 39 to 25</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h1><strong>Rarity of set rings and amulets</strong></h1>
<blockquote>
  <p>Same thing with the uniques. This primarily affects the set amulets that were rarity 1.</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
  <li>Adjusted the rarity(weighting) of many amulets from 7 to 3 to reduce the overall pick choice down from 80 to 47.</li>
  <li>Many rings reduced down to 3 rarity. Total rarity reduced from 68 to 45</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

      <li>This basically removes the change I made previously which allowed for ridiculously high elemental damage scaling as enchant has been nerfed. Also knocks out leech multiplier.</li>

</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

  <li>Character sheet reflects weapon damage alone until synergies are applied on throw.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3><strong>Carnage</strong></h3>
<blockquote>
  <p>Improved overall feel of the skill as there is a much more immediate impact instead of the 1.5-2s delay from swing to spike re-target and damage dealing, updated visuals give a much better idea of what the skill is doing and where the damage is coming from and it just looks even cooler.</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
  <li>Tornado is still visual only and spawns on swing</li>
  <li>Spikes spawn on weapon swing instead of after tornado animation finishes<ul>

  <li>Carnage is no longer able to be used when shape shifted</li>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3><strong>Battle orders</strong></h3>

  <li>Diminishing return max decreased from 80 to 50.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3><strong>Melee mastery</strong></h3>
<blockquote>
  <p>Melee mastery provides a ton of damage% and attack rating% as well as crit chance. Due to how the diminishing returns formula works you hit near max crit chance after only a few levels. This change incentivizes barbarians to put points into it(if you were melee you already did), and limits its full power as an oskill.</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
  <li>Crit chance changed from diminishing returns up to 35% to 10% baseline +1% per base level</li>
