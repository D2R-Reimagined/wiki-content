<p><mark class="pen-red">Intro</mark><br>This is a melee spearzon that destroys high player count and it has very fast bossing ability.<br>It's an iconic build in vanilla, and the fastest Uber killer back then, which was only rivaled by Mosaic Sin.<br>In D2RR things are different, but the character is still a complete beast and has no issues whatsoever.<br>It is easy to play, tanky, and while lacking the Javazon's powerful clear ability, it has his own charm and benefit to playing.<br>Its absolutely a blast to spear everything in your way.<br>So have fun and enjoy this build.<br><br>&nbsp;<br><mark class="pen-red">Stats</mark><br><mark class="pen-green">Strength</mark> - Enough to wear your gear<br><mark class="pen-green">Dexterity</mark> - Enough to wear your gear<br><mark class="pen-green">Vitality</mark> - Everything<br><mark class="pen-green">Energy</mark> - Can be invested a bit while leveling, but 0 in Mid-Endgame<br><br><mark class="pen-red">Skills</mark><br><mark class="pen-green">1 Point :</mark><br>Dodge<br>Avoid<br>Evade<br>Critical Strike<br><br>This build doesn't need pierce and you just put the obvious 1 point wonders.</p>
<p><mark class="pen-green">25 Points :</mark> &nbsp;<br>Lightning Strike - This is your crowd clear and farming skill<br>Charged Strike - This is your single target/Boss killer skill<br>Lightning Bolt - Synergy<br>Power Strike - Synergy<br>Penetrate - Put the leftovers here.&nbsp;</p>
<p><mark class="pen-red">Gameplay</mark><br>The loop is very simple.<br>Teleport/Walk → Ligthning Strike everything → Charge Strike small number targets/champs/bosses<br>That's literally it. Impressively hard.<br><br><mark class="pen-red">Gear and Breakpoints</mark></p>
<p><mark class="pen-green">Important BPs to reach</mark><br>IAS - 50 - with Fanaticism 6 from A5 merc, easy to reach.<br>FHR - 48/86 - Depends if you want to invest in 86 or not.<br>FCR &nbsp;- 99 - Just get it, its nice.</p>
<p><mark class="pen-green">Weapon - Matriarchal Spear (Infinity)</mark><br>Superior Matriarchal Spear base, corrupt until you get -res. Upgrade it 10 times with +- Lightning Damage<br>The choice is Matriachal Spear because its the fastest class specific spear.</p>
<p><mark class="pen-green">Armor - Tarasque Hide / Ormus Robes</mark><br>Extremely good defensive armor vs. Extremely glass cannon offensive armor.<br>I personally chose the Tarasque Hide cause it almost covers our resistances and DR alone. It make it easy to build around.<br>The corrupt you are searching for is HP/All skill. Upgrade it with All resist+Max resist.</p>
<p><mark class="pen-green">Helm - Griffon's Eye</mark><br>Nothing to say. BiS for lightning users.<br>Corrupt with whatever you can get. Upgrade it with +6 Lightning skills.</p>
<p><mark class="pen-green">Gloves - Rare/Crafted +3 Javelin and Spear gloves.</mark><br>Crafted are great but CB won't help much, so Rare will do as well. You want IAS here.<br>Corrupt with IAS if you can. Upgrade as follows depending on your needs to reach your BPs. FCR/IAS/50HP/6%HP</p>
<p><mark class="pen-green">Boots - Zero Effect</mark><br>God tier defensive boots.<br>Corrupt with DR. Upgrade with Max HP+Max Mana</p>
<p><mark class="pen-green">Belt - Arachnid Mesh</mark><br>Really strong belt thats hard to beat. Corrupt with PDR and MR. Upgrade with FHR to reach a BP. PDR or HP if you dont care.</p>
<p><mark class="pen-green">Crafted Amulet +3 All skill.</mark><br>Cannot beat this craft. Expensive hard to get what you want, but there is nothing better.<br>Corrupt with whatever you can if you dare. Upgrade with Amazon Skills.</p>
<p><mark class="pen-green">Rings</mark> - &nbsp;I have 3 suggestions here.<br>To reach BPs of IAS/FCR wear Rare rings until you find better rings.<br>2x Fearie Rings. The HP boost is huge, and if you corrupt it with IAS, you're the king. Upgrade with FCR if you do.<br>2x Stone of Jordan+2sk. Very hard to come by. Corrupt it if you dare. Upgrade to reach BPs</p>
<p><mark class="pen-green">Charm Inventory</mark>&nbsp;<br>Charm inventory is very straight forward. 10x 1to All Skill Grand Charms, Upgraded Torch,Upgraded Anni, Life &amp; Death, Queen's Call, Remembrance of glory.</p>
<p><br><br><mark class="pen-red">A5 Merc's Gear</mark><br>2xPhase Blade (Plague)<br>Sacred Armor (Fortitude)<br>Guardian Crown (Prowess in Battle)<br>LoH (Seriously I don't think about this slot)<br>Zero Effect<br>Kashya's Ward<br>Dual Chiad Halo, or IAS for BP<br>Amulet is Vanquisher, in general it doesn't matter.<br><br>A5 Merc provides 2 very valuable auras the keeps your build together. Fanaticism and Cleansing. Thanks to such a high level of cleansing your are almost immortal. Procing lower resist for you is not a big deal, but when it happens its really great.<br>&nbsp;</p>
<p><mark class="pen-red">Conclusion</mark><br>The class is meant for people that like melee gameplay with a lot of elemental damage. It does everything the game has to offer very well.<br>Enjoy and cherish it as it will make you happy destroying everything in your way as well as rich during the process.<br>My personal rating on this build and character is 10/10. Cause it's just great and not overpowered like its Javazon counterpart.</p>
