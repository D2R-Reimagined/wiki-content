# D2RR 3.0.0 Patch Notes

Support for Warlock DLC + D2R 3.0

## Itemization Re-work

https://wiki.d2r-reimagined.com/en/Patch_Notes/D2RR_3_0_0_Item_Changes

## New Unique Charm and Jewelry Sprites

See [_#919_](https://github.com/D2R-Reimagined/d2r-reimagined-mod/pull/919) and [_#923_](https://github.com/D2R-Reimagined/d2r-reimagined-mod/pull/923)

## All Skill Icons Reworked from Scratch

See [_#944_](https://github.com/D2R-Reimagined/d2r-reimagined-mod/pull/944)

## Item Upgrade System Renamed to Enchantments

> Item Upgrade as a name was flawed and confusing. It has been renamed "Enchantments" now.

- Uber charms and other systems that need upgrades still say "upgrades".

## Rarity of Unique Rings, Amulets, Charms, and Jewels Tweaked

> The goal here is to reduce the rarity disparity that exists. A good example is the unique grand charm Nightshade had a rarity of 5 and all others were set to 1, so you almost always found Nightshade (this has been reduced to 2). The overall changes to rings means that items like SOJ will be slightly more common. Many chase items were left or reduced to 1 rarity, and adjustments to 1 rarity rings/amulets that did not fit there were bumped up.
>
> The jewel rarities had many at 1, and several at 5 which skewed the rolls. Now there are a handful at 2 and the rest at one. Primarily the elemental jewels that did not have elemental pen are set to rarity 2. Typical facets are left at rarity 1.



## Rarity of Set Rings and Amulets

> Same thing with the uniques. This primarily affects the set amulets that were rarity 1.


## Non Class Skill Changes
### Chance to cast specific skills/Additions
> Chance to cast(CTC) skills are relatively underwhelming, or useless, due to missing synergies. Thus many CTC skills were cloned, given new skill curves, and have slightly altered visuals.

- <ins>Winter's Pulse:</ins> Cloned Frost nova with a damage curve of 100-150 cold damage per level

- -10% All Maximum Resistances starting and grows by -1% with bonus levels up to a max of -35.
    - Base levels decrease to or maintain this penalty at -10%.

> Penetrate having the permanent bonus of additional pierce was boring and I wanted to combine dodge and avoid so I needed to dream up something to replace them, this is the result.

#### Impale
- Required level increased to 18 from 12.

#### Lightning Bolt
- Lightning conversion reduced to 50% from 100%.
- Added Attack Rating scaling.
- Lightning also strikes a target when hit (will cast on further out enemies also if the initial is pierced) that does a small AOE after a short delay (0.5 seconds for the cool visuals).

- Lightning Strike, Bolt, and Fury as synergies.

> Want to revisit if needed in the future to potentially alter projectile growth. Left alone for now due to LS buffs.

#### Plague Javelin
- Changed prerequisite to Poison Javelin.
- Added Toxic Whirl synergy and adjusted so damage is unchanged.
- Removed length growth and made it a flat 6 seconds.

#### Meteoric Arrow (Renamed from Immolation Arrow)
- Reworked, now casts Meteor on hit instead of random ground fire thing.
- Adjusted damage curves for new ability.
- Adjusted synergy to 8%.
- Meteor hit deals weapon damage, but the explosion and the fire DoT do not.
- Meteors will cast multiple times if the arrow pierces enemies.

#### Titans Covenant (Renamed from Dopplezon/Decoy)
> Reworked because Decoy is so buggy. Self-only aura that reduces movement speed, attack speed, and physical damage reduction in exchange for increased global physical damage and crushing blow.

- Requires level 30.
- FRW and IAS range of -25% to -50%.
    - Soft points increase (cap -50%).

- Gains 1% Crushing Blow per 4 base/soft points to a cap of 25%.

#### Evade
- 5+1% per level + 1% per every 3 levels post level 25.
    - Base points increase this bonus by 2% per point.

#### Fend
> Reworked to do an AOE sporadic missile that hits enemies closest to where it spawns from, gives bonus defense in exchange for entirely disabling chance to block if wearing a shield so that while usable with jav/shield it encourages spear use.

- Required level increased to 30.
- Grants base 5% defense +1% per level for a second on use and disables block for that duration.
- Due to the use of slam_state for synergy for missile damage, the character sheet display is correct on idle and inflated on use.
- Damage synergy lowered to 4% due to the nature of the rework.
- Spawns around 6-8 missiles on striking.

#### Glacial Orb Arrow (Renamed from Ice Arrow)
- Required level moved to 30 (formerly Freezing Arrow).

- Increased Curve 4 and 5.
- Increased synergy to 12% from 11%.
- Synergy: Charged Strike, Lightning Bolt, Lightning Fury.

> Overall damage buff while reducing the level requirement and toning down the travel range; if this skill doesn't see more use then it and CS can be revisited.

#### Lightning Fury
- 3 bolts to begin, adds 1 every 4 to a max of 24 instead of 3 + 1 per level with no cap.
- Target search radius reduced to 12 from 15.
- Added Attack Rating scaling.
- Removed Power Strike as synergy due to rework; this also results in a damage nerf as nothing was added in compensation.

> If this cripples the skill I will revisit and adjust the damage to bring it back into usability but testing shows that it feels the same in the end game and results in being less instantly OP in the mid to late game.

## Assassin

- Now shoots a ring of magic skulls that collapse in on itself.
- Synergizes with all trap skills.
- Now shoots 5 times + 1 per 5 base levels.
- Mana cost changed from 20 at all levels to 10 + 0.5/lvl.

#### Chasm Break
- Reduced life steal efficiency for skill to 10%.
- Reduced initial weapon damage from 75% to 62%.
- Character sheet reflects weapon damage alone until synergies are applied on throw.

#### Carnage
> Improved overall feel of the skill as there is a much more immediate impact instead of the 1.5-2s delay from swing to spike re-target and damage dealing. Updated visuals give a much better idea of what the skill is doing and where the damage is coming from, and it just looks even cooler.

- Tornado is still visual only and spawns on swing.
- Spikes spawn on weapon swing instead of after tornado animation finishes.
    - Spikes updated visually with red glow to make it much more apparent what the skill is doing.

#### Melee Mastery
> Melee mastery provides a ton of damage% and attack rating% as well as crit chance. Due to how the diminishing returns formula works, you hit near max crit chance after only a few levels. This change incentivizes Barbarians to put points into it (if you were melee you already did), and limits its full power as an oskill.

- Crit chance changed from diminishing returns up to 35% to 10% baseline + 1% per base level.

- New synergy with Lycanthropy:

- Baseline HP% lowered from 75% to 50%.
- Damage% baseline lowered from 55% to 20%.

## Misc Files

Skill tree updates for prerequisite changes and skill re-ordering, visuals for the two new auras, icons for the new/reworked skills.
- Replaced Avoid with Dodge (Dodge & Avoid) on items.
- Replaced Dopplezon (Decoy) with Valkyrie on items.

### Charm Weight
- Fixed automagic, skills properties, and the armor/weapons so that the weight system no longer applies a minimum level requirement of 7 to items.
> This also solves the problem with level 6 spells being usable at level 1 and level 12 usable at level 6.

### Skill Gold Cost Affect
- Skills no longer have much effect on the cost, sell price, or repair price of items, with the exception of Teleport, which will still be substantial.
> This solves infinite gambling and gives incentive to use charged items more by not being so expensive to repair (with the exception of Teleport). We'll revise gold and make adjustments until it feels good without the infinite gambling.

- Teleport is unaffected by this change; it will still cost a substantial amount.

### Base Item Changes

## Monster Changes

## Set Items

### Tal Rasha's Wrappings
> The start of an effort to revisit some vanilla sets and provide some love. For Tal's, keeping the theme of providing general elemental damage allowing for hybrid Sorceress builds or just being useful for any build. Should now act as a useful mid/early endgame set. A few additional stats were added; the helm now also has set bonuses.

### Treasure Hunter
> Didn't feel like it had real oomph for being a Magic Find (MF) set. Now fills the niche of anyone wanting to MF with the vanilla MF items as a set.

### Immortal King
> Given a few numerical increases to the items, a few random Barbarian skill rolls, as well as a set-specific skill and buff: King's Trinity and King's Charisma.
>
> **King's Trinity**: Creates a cold/fire/lightning tornado nova on strike. Initial strike is physical, and each elemental missile is converted from 37% of weapon damage to that element.
>
> **King's Charisma**: Provides a flat +1000-2000 cold/fire/lightning damage to attacks.
