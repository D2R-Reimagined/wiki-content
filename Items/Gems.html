<h1>&nbsp;</h1>
<h1>Gems</h1>
<p>Gem qualities (e.g. chipped, flawed, normal, flawless, perfect) have been removed.</p>
<p>All gems drop from Act 2, Arcane Sanctuary onwards and require level 18 to use.</p>

<h2>Gem Bag</h2>
<p>All new characters start with a Gem Bag in their inventory, and replacements can be purchased from vendors should you somehow misplace it.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Gem Bag is used to store large numbers of gems as a universal currency.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Gems can be retrieved using ‘grabbers’ (also purchased from vendors).</p>
<p>If a crafting recipe creates a new item and requires gems you can use the Gem Bag as the Gem reagent (as long as you have enough gems stored), e.g. : REROLL CHARM - Gem Bag (3 Gems) + Magic&nbsp;Grand Charm = New Magic&nbsp;Grand Charm (100% plvl)</p>
<p>If a recipe calls for gems to change an existing item then gems need to be used instead of the bag, e.g.:</p>
<p>ADD ITEM STAT - Amulet &amp; 9 Emeralds = +1 to Druid Skills</p>
