<p><mark class="pen-red"><strong>Due to file size limitations in D2R, it is highly advised that you keep all STACKED ITEMS, KEYCHAINS, and GEM BAGS in a SHARED STASH TAB to prevent items from disappearing</strong></mark></p>
<h2><strong>Characters</strong></h2>
<p>- Skills cap out at 25 hard points, up from 20.</p>

<p>- You can respec at any time by purchasing a Token of Absolution from potion vendors in each act.</p>
<h2><strong>Items</strong></h2>

<p>- Stacked Items: many useful miscellaneous items drop as 'stacks' (the + sign in the top-left is a visual indicator), which can store up to 100 in a stack.&nbsp;<br>This helps with storing them without taking up lots of inventory/stash space.</p>
<figure class="image image_resized" style="width:30.4%;"><img src="/rune_stack.png"></figure>
<p>- Retrieve socketed items: you can purchase two different types of item from Blacksmith vendors that allows you to retrieve socketed items from weapons and armor.</p>
<p>- Re-roll Items into White Bases: Item + Hel Rune + El Rune, re-rolls the item as a white base with new affixes.</p>
<p>- Item Upgrades: Check the <a href="https://wiki.d2r-reimagined.com/en/Items/AddItemStats">Add Item Stat Recipes</a> page.</p>
<p>- Crafting: Check the <a href="https://wiki.d2r-reimagined.com/en/Crafting">Item Crafting</a> about how to craft various powerful items.</p>
<p>- Essence drops have been replaced by <a href="https://wiki.d2r-reimagined.com/en/Items/Orbs">Socketing Orbs</a>.</p>
<p>- Jewels can be used to 'socket-punch' items when you want a <a href="https://diablo2.diablowiki.net/Sockets">specific number of sockets</a> (as long as the item supports it).&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp; - Item Rarity = Jewel Rarity required to punch sockets with</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; - Note that number of open sockets is dependent on the ilvl of the item</p>
<p>&nbsp; - All Elite Helms can roll up to 4 sockets in Reimagined!</p>
<h2><strong>Quality of Life</strong></h2>
<p>- Cube a rune or rune stack with an ID Tome to downgrade&nbsp;a rune to the next tier lower.&nbsp;</p>
<p>- Cube two of the same rune or a rune stack with a TP Tome to obtain a rune from the next tier higher.</p>
<p>- You can store all of your <a href="https://d2rr.wiki.gg/wiki/Gems">Gems</a> in a gem bag, and use the bag directly in lots of crating recipes without having to take gems out beforehand!</p>
<p>- Gem grabbers are used to retrieve gems from the bag. Gem grabbers can be purchased from most vendors.</p>
<p>- Infernal Keys can be stored in a Keychain, and extracted with the appropriate key grabber. Grabbers can be found at many vendors.</p>

<p>- Melee Characters can obtain a Small Charm ( <a href="https://d2rr.wiki.gg/wiki/Charms">Collin's Might</a> ) that makes your melee attacks deal splash damage&nbsp;<br>The charm drops from Corpsefire in the Den of Evil on normal (once per game, and only if you don't have one in inventory already).&nbsp;<br>It can be upgraded a number of times via cube recipes to deal more damage and have less penalties.</p>
<p>- Terror Zones changed to rotate between 5 sets. Each TZ rotation is Act based and contains most of the original TZs within that act. Cows is under Act 4 due to the limit on number of TZs allowed</p>
