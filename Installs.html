<h1>Installation Guides</h1>
<p>Below is a compilation of useful information and guides.</p>
<p>Before getting started, take a second to make a backup of your files (this is always good practice before making changes)!</p>
<h3>File Locations</h3>
<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Mod Files:</strong> C:\Program Files (x86)\Diablo II Resurrected\mods\Reimagined</p>
  <p><i><strong>Save Files:</strong> C:\Users\&lt;YOURNAME&gt;\Saved Games\Diablo II Resurrected\mods\Reimagined</i></p>
  <p><i><mark class="pen-red">Your install and save locations may vary depending on your setup!</mark></i></p>
</blockquote>
<h3>Making Backups</h3>
<p>In File Explorer, navigate to your your D2R install and Saved Games directories.</p>
<p>Right click the directory, select ‘compress to…’ and choose ZIP file. Rename the ZIP file to something memorable, and move it somewhere easy to remember (e.g. your desktop).</p>
<p>Remember to periodically create new ZIP folders so that you don't lose progress in case of crashes, exceeding your save file data limit, etc..</p>
<h2><br>D2RMM</h2>
<p><a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/diablo2resurrected/mods/169">D2RMM on Nexus Mods</a></p>
<p>Using a Mod Manager allows you to easily install a variety of mods together (assuming they play nice) without having to know anything about modding.</p>
<h3><br>Reimagined Features:</h3>
<p>Reimagined is packed full of expansive features and QOL updates, so installing extra mods isn't always necessary.</p>
<p>If you have questions about whether something is included in Reimagined, or would like to see something added, DM one of the Devs, or post in the suggestions-and-feedback channel of our discord channel.</p>
<p>A number of Mod Creators gave express permission to include their mod in Reimagined. Where this is the case credit is given on the <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/diablo2resurrected/mods/503?tab=description">Reimagined Nexus Mods</a> page.</p>

<h3>Loot Filters</h3>
<p>Reimagined doesn't yet include a built-in Loot Filter.</p>
<p>One of the most popular reasons to use a Mod Manager is to install a 3rd-party Loot Filter to help reduce clutter.</p>
<p>Below we'll take you through a step-by-step guide on how to install and configure a loot filter. We recommend <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/diablo2resurrected/mods/467">Pseudo Loot Filter</a>.</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>This guide assumes you have already downloaded and installed D2RMM (see above)</p>
</blockquote>
<h4>File Steps</h4>
<p>1. Open your D2RMM folder and navigate to the mods directory</p>
<ul>
  <li>You should see a text file called 'PUT YOUR MODS HERE' - leave this window open, we'll use it later</li>
</ul>
<p>2. Open a new File Explorer window and navigate to your Reimagined mod folder</p>
<p>3. Copy the Reimagined.mpq folder (this should contain Data and ModInfo.json)</p>
<p>4. Paste the Reimagined.mpq folder into the D2RMM/mods folder from step 2</p>
<ul>
  <li>Feel free to rename Reimagined.mpq to something that makes more sense to you (e.g. Reimagined)</li>
</ul>
<h4>D2RMM Steps</h4>
<p>5. Open D2RMM as Administrator. Once open, click the three dots in the bottom-right corner and select 'Refresh Mod List'</p>
<p>6. Reimagined.mpq should appear in the mod list (or whatever you renamed the folder to)</p>
<p>7. Navigate to the Settings tab (at the top)</p>
<ul>
  <li>7a. Click on General<ul>
      <li>Change 'Output Mod Name' to 'Reimagined'</li>
      <li>Toggle 'Automatically install mods before running the game'</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>7b. Click on Game Launcher<ul>
      <li>Under 'Extra Game Args', paste the following: -mod Reimagined -txt</li>
      <li>Feel free to add any other args you want here</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>
<p>8. Navigate back to the Mods tab</p>
<p>9. Click Install Mods</p>
<h4><br>Save File Steps</h4>
<p>10. In File Explorer, navigate to your Saved Games directory</p>
<p>11. Check the Reimagined folder - if you see your save files, you're good to go!&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
  <li>If the folder is empty, copy the contents from the backup folder you created earlier, and paste the contents in the empty Reimagined folder.</li>
</ul>
<p>12. Hit 'Run D2R' in D2RMM and have fun!</p>
<h4><br>FAQ:</h4>
<p>My mod isn't showing up in the mod list on D2RMM?</p>
<ol>
  <li>Either you didn't put the Reimagined.mpq folder in D2RMM/mods or it's in a sub-folder called Reimagined</li>
  <li>Run D2RMM as administrator</li>
  <li>You may need to follow step 8 to update the Output Mod Name</li>
</ol>
