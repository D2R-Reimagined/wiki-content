<p><mark class="pen-red">Intro</mark><br>The Diablo 2 Reimagined Summon Necromancer is an exceptionally powerful and enjoyable build that excels at all content, even on the highest difficulty (Players 8), by potentially commanding an army of over 100 summons.</p>
<p>The build focuses on maximizing summon damage and survivability through <strong>auras</strong> and <strong>item synergies</strong>. A crucial component is the <strong>Act 3 Fire Enchant Mercenary</strong>, who significantly buffs all minions with an extra 4k fire damage per summon via their high-level Enchant skill.</p>
<p>Players can choose between a <strong>level 50+ Concentration Aura</strong> or a <strong>level 50+ Fanaticism Aura</strong> to further amplify summon damage by switching out ‘Knights Dawn’ Shield or ‘Terror Runeword’ shield. Fanaticism also provides an attack speed boost.</p>
<p>An <strong>Iron Golem</strong> summoned from an <strong>Infinity runeword weapon</strong> provides a constant <strong>level 12 Conviction Aura</strong>, drastically reducing enemy resistances, including fire resistance, which synergizes with the Enchanted minions. New 2.1 unique jewel recipes make acquiring high-level gear more accessible. In addition to the summon army, the Necromancer can cast a <strong>Bone Spirit</strong> spell that deals 10k magic damage, providing versatility against various enemy types.</p>
<p>This build offers a dynamic playstyle, allowing players to overwhelm enemies with a massive army while also contributing direct damage and support.</p>
