  <p><mark class="pen-red"><strong>IMPORTANT:</strong></mark></p>
  <p>Storing a large quantity of small items (Small Charms, Large Charms, Grand Charms, Jewels, Rings, Amulets, Belts, Etc.) in your Personal Stash and/or Horadric Cube in between game sessions (Save and Exit) can drastically increase the file size of your character which has a<strong><u> hardcoded limit of 8192 bytes on disk or around 8KB.</u></strong></p>
  <p>The file to watch is (charname).d2s in C:\Users\(your user)\Saved Games\Diablo II Resurrected\mods\Reimagined.</p>
  <p>Keep smaller items(1x1 size) like jewels in Shared Tabs if using Personal tab for rune/orb stack storage. If you store Rune and Orb stacks in your personal tab, keep them stacked together, a stack of 100 quantity takes up less file space than 2 stacks of 1 quantity.</p>
  <p>Failure to be aware of the file size limit and follow these basic guidelines will eventually result in items disappearing!</p>
  <p><mark class="pen-red"><strong>Never use the Horadric Cube for in between game storage, (Save and Exit), the cube contributes to your save file limit. Items disappear when the file size has reached the limit above.</strong></mark></p>

<h2>Gameplay Changes:</h2>
<p>- Nightmare difficulty will feel the same until around mid Act 3 where the level starts to ramp up to accommodate the new Hell changes. By the end of Act 5 and killing Baal the area level is around 69-70 and Nightmare Terror Zone level cap is increased to 80 to facilitate farming before attempting to tackle Hell difficulty.</p>
<p>- Hell difficulty has been scaled up from the original game to encompass levels 90+ as well as terror zone level cap increased to 99. It is recommended to farm in NM TZ until 85+ and getting resistances situated and your build a goal before attempting Hell.<br>&nbsp; - Monster HP is about 4X higher and damage is about 1.5X higher on all player counts.</p>
<p>- Terror Zones changed to rotate between 5 sets. Each TZ rotation is Act based and contains most of the original TZs within that act. Cows are under Act 4 due to the limit on number of TZs allowed.</p>
<p>- Cow Level Portal now only requires Wirt's Leg to open.</p>
<p>- Countess rune drop table revised, highest rune is now:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Normal: THUL, down from SOL</li>
  <li>Nightmare: KO, down from IST</li>
  <li>Hell: VEX, down from ZOD</li>
  <li>Countess Rune drop table has been extended to other Super Uniques:<ul>
      <li>Act 2 - Halls of the Dead: Bloodwitch the Wild</li>
      <li>Act 3 - Ruined Temple: Battlemaiden Sarina</li>
      <li>Act 4 - River of Flame: Hephasto (Countess Table +1, Normal: DOL, Nightmare: UM, Hell: LO)</li>
