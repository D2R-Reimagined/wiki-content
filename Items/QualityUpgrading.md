# Upgrading the Quality of your Armor or Weapon	
[N] = Normal
[X] = Exceptional
[E] = Elite (*best*)

These are the three different tiers with [N] having the lowest level requirements along with the lowest defense on armor & weakest damage on weapons.  With [E] having the highest level requirements along with the highest defense on armor & highest damage on weapons.

It's important to note that even in the [E] Elite category, not all armor and weapons are equal.  If you are creating a runeword, it's important to take note of the str & dex requirements when picking a base.  While you can grab any random white chest piece you find to add sockets, a barbarian class should strive to find the highest Defense possible which is the Sacred Armor.

There are specific 1H, 2H and ranged weapons that have higher damage then others that scale exceptionally well with the Enhanced Damage % modifier.  While Blizzard typically sets these as a slower attack speed base, there are addstats/charms/jewels/runes to assist with Increased Attack Speed.  Getting a significantly high Enhanced Damage % on a weaker base is fine while leveling, but for end game the goal should be using a runeword or crafting with the highest damage ranged base your class can equip.

## When to pick a particular Armor or Weapon type
The most important time to put some thought into a certain type of Armor or Weapon is either when you are using the very expensive crafting system or when you are about to make an end game runeword item.

When you have a chest piece of armor where the base has 200 defense, if it has +200% Enhanced Defense from crafting or from a runeword then it would have 600 defense.  If you had a chest piece of armor where the base has 500 defense, then the +200% Enhanced Defense from crafting or from a runeword then it would have 1500 defense.  This becomes extremely important for physical damage classes when picking a weapon!

### Other times to pick a specific base
A) When you have an Orb of Conversion & want a chance at getting a certain unique item.
B) When you have an Orb of Assemblage & want a chance at getting a certain set item.
C) When you have an Orb of Infusion & want the best rare, picking the best item is key.

## What is possible in Reimagined
You can upgrade a rare, set or unique from [N] to [X]
You can upgrade a rare, set or unique from [X] to [E]

You can change a grey or magic item to white with the HEL+EL recipe
You can change that white item to rare with an Orb of Infusion, allowing [X] or [E] upgrades.

Using the gambling system in-game, players can obtain any specific item and rather quickly upgrade the base to the exact item you want.  Force it to white, punch the specific sockets needed for a runeword using magic jewels.  Or force it rare to be used with an orb at a chance of becoming a specific unique or set piece.  The end game crafting recipes hold exceptional power, but due to their high cost worth of ingredients, put extra thought into the base you want to use as that is used for the randomized crafted armor or weapon.

## Example of how to get a specific base for Orb of Conversion usage
Let's pretend you found an "Orb of Conversion" & you wanted a chance at getting the "Tarrasque Hide" unique chestpiece.  I will walk through the steps I typically take and add some pictures along the way.

We lookup the stats on the reimagined website, here in the picture we see that the base is a "Boneweave" armor.  

There are different websites you can visit, but the one I typically go to is here where I'll find the "Armor" or "Weapons" sections. https://www.purediablo.com/diablo-2

Since we are looking for a Boneweave, I will click on "Body Armor" on the website.
https://www.purediablo.com/diablo-2/diablo-2-body-armor

As seen in the picture, there are 15 different chest armors in each of the N, X & E categories.

So we look for the "Boneweave" and realize it is an Elite [E] item.  The website shows it as 4.8 on the list.  If we click on the name we can see the picture of the base in-game.

Now going back to the list instead of clicking on 4.8 we will click on 2.8 which is "Chain Mail".  This is the Normal [N] version of this exact armor.  So with this information, heading in-game to a gambling vendor you can simply gamble for a "Chain Mail" until you get a blue magic [E] version which you can HEL+EL to white, then force to rare with an Orb of Infusion.  Or you can gamble until you happen to find  any quality of a rare & then upgrade that to [X] or [E].

To be clear, when gambling for a "Chain Mail" specifically you will always randomly be getting one of these three versions of quality of this item:
[N] = Chain Mail
[X] = Mesh Armor
[E] = Boneweave

The website shows there are only two unique Boneweave armors, however due to rarity weighting it is not a 50% chance at either chestpiece when using an Orb of Conversion.  While you could spend hours or days hunting for a specific item on the ground, forcing one by gambling for use with your orbs or crafting needs is the faster way to go about it.

Weapons are the same way, three different versions of the same weapon.  Once you understand the system & how the in-game graphic is the same on all 3 versions, it makes getting the base you're looking for rather easy & fast.

# Upgrading your gear while leveling can make a huge difference
Here are a few examples for a Barbarian and for an Act2 Mercenary while leveling.  This shows how the Enhanced Damage % on a weapon scales directly with the base.  So enormous changes in your damage output occurs when upgrading a physical damage weapon!
