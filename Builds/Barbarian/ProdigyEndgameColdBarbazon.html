<p><mark class="pen-red">Intro</mark><br>This is the new type of barb. After the defeat at mount arreat some of the barbs fled, and some of the reached the South Sea, meeting the warriors of Askari also known as Amazons, master of throwing arts. /s</p>
<p>It's a really good endgame barb build focusing on the mid/short range attacks. It uses strong cold attack given by his kit and some of the gear, and exploiting the phisical damage Winter's Gambit projectiles deal additional crushing blow, leech (optional) and pierce. It clears high density relatively fast, deletes bosses and deals with ubers reasonably.</p>
<p>Enjoy the build as its very straight-forward<br>&nbsp;</p>

<p><mark class="pen-green">25 Points :</mark> &nbsp;<br>Winter's Gambit - Piercing Physical/Cold projectiles that can pierce, proc, leech. Main Skill<br>Madawk's Fury - God Tier buff that boosts throwing weapons and gives additional Cold damage.<br>Chasm Break - Synergy, useable from time to time if you don't have gear.<br>Unstopable Force - Synergy, projectile too slow for my taste, so I left it last.</p>
<p><mark class="pen-red">Gameplay</mark><br>The loop is very simple.<br>Buff → Teleport → Winter's Gambit --&gt; Win<br>Reposition fluidly to maximize your damage or target an elite, you will get used to the projectiles with time.<br>Being squishy a bit, don't try to tank everything. Bad Idea on ubers, know when to back off and when to greed out.<br><br><mark class="pen-red">Gear and Breakpoints</mark></p>
<p><mark class="pen-green">Important BPs to reach</mark><br>IAS - 22 (With level 15 fanaticism) - 9 Frames - Reaching these frames will make you a bit faster. They are not spectacular, but its good to have it.<br>FHR - 48 - You can try higher but here is a very comfortable spot. Don't try to stretch.<br>FCR - Not important - Push it if care, but it is a non factor.<br>FBR - 86 is ideal but hard to reach. Don't stretch if you can't</p>
<p><mark class="pen-green">Weapon - Splinterfreeze (Unique)</mark><br>Cold mastery, gives this weapon the edge over (Frostbite Shard). Uptier it, it matters for leech and gives a decent chunk of physical.&nbsp;<br>Upgrade with +511 Rainbow damage and 4x Cold upgrades.<br>Corrupt : +- All elemental damage</p>
<p><mark class="pen-green">Off-Hand - Monarch (Crafted - 2 All Skills +- Elemental%)</mark><br>Anything you get is good. Ideally some block if you aren't sure you gonna reach it, FBR is good, anything that can help with breakpoints, or some damage.<br>Sockets - Cold Facets<br>Upgrades - Max Res/ DR, if you don't care FBR<br>Corrupt : It's a costly craft, so get what you can if you dare.</p>
<p><mark class="pen-green">Armor - Cold Comfort (Unique)</mark><br>Pretty good +- cold armor.<br>Sockets - Cold Facets<br>Upgrades - Max Res<br>Corrupt - Life% is nice and simple to get.&nbsp;</p>
<p><mark class="pen-green">Helm - Nightwing's Veil (Unique)</mark><br>No brainer helm for cold builds.<br>Sockets - Cold Facets<br>Upgrades - Uncertain that cold skills upgrade work, I used All skill upgrade.&nbsp;<br>Corrupt - Don't need CBF so get whatever you can.</p>
<p><mark class="pen-green">Gloves - Any Elite Base (Crafted - +1 All skills - Crushing blow/level)</mark><br>Helps cap your pierce, much needed CB, OW for uber adventures.<br>Upgrades - 1x Pierce, 1x Open Wounds, 1x Crushing Blow<br>Corrupt - Crushing Blow</p>
<p><mark class="pen-green">Boots - Stallion Hooves (Unique)</mark><br>Too good to pass out. CB,DS,Dex,Max Damage. You won't beat it. For this class, Zero effect boots are completely out of the picture.<br>Upgrades - HP/Max Mana.<br>Corrupt - Get whatever you can.<br><br><mark class="pen-green">Belt - Ecstacy of Ishtar (Unique)</mark><br>Great help to capping pierce<br>Upgrades - DR/HP/MaxHP , choose what you need.<br>Corrupt - PDR/MDR</p>
<p><mark class="pen-green">Amulet - (Crafted - 2 All Skills, +- Elemental Damage)</mark><br>Expensive but can't be beat.<br>Corrupt - Whatever you can get on a good amu.<br>Upgrades - +1 Barb Skill , +2 Random Barb and pray</p>
<p><mark class="pen-green">Rings</mark> - &nbsp;Fearie Ring / Jordan's Sigil<br>Fearie ring is hard to beat, but Jordan big number go boom. Hulk smash. Its rare as a unicorn so stick with Fearie until then.<br>Corrupt - PDR/MDR, Max Res<br>Upgrades - One of the rings has to have 2x Increased Attack Speed, to reach the break point. The other, you can cover whatever you currently need.<br><br><mark class="pen-green">Charm Inventory</mark>&nbsp;<br>Crafted Enhanced damage/Strenght/Dex Charms<br>Beacon and Soulstone<br>Life and Death, Remembrance of glory, Conclave of Elements, Queen's Call, Nightshade (optional)<br>Crafted charms will cover requirements,attack rating, give some cold damage and physical damage.<br>Alternatively you can stack +1 All skill charms for maximum damage.<br><br><mark class="pen-red">Hannah or Kyoko</mark><br>Matriacal Bow (Faith) - To ease up your rough IAS bp<br>Quiver of Resistance Slaying<br>Sacred Armor (Fortitude)<br>Andariel Visage (4 Bers)<br>Laying of Hands<br>Zero Effect<br>Kashia's Ward<br>Dual Chiad Halo, or IAS for BP, or All Skill for minor Might boost. Your choice.<br>Amulet - Even mara is good, she is not a pretentious girl and will wear whatever you give her, show some love tho.<br><br>So A1 Merc is here for Fanaticism and LR proc, so yeah, moral support. Don't expect any damage.<br>&nbsp;</p>
<p><mark class="pen-red">Conclusion</mark><br>I'm willing to give this barb build 10/10 just cause this class was neglected until now and its literally top tier compared to anything else.</p>
