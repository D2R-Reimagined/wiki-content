<h2>General Changes</h2>
<ul>
  <li>From <a href="https://github.com/D2R-Reimagined/d2r-reimagined-mod/pull/847">PR847:</a> Goal is to pull power out of the masteries and put them into the skills and synergies. Initially started because of various OSkills and Enchant, this initial pass is has expanded to feel things out and swing a nerf bat at some outlier skills, and buff up some underperforming or cumbersome ones. Please give each element a try as well as some hybridization, the masteries still provide some power as 1 points, and synergies were cut back to limit them to the skill itself and 2 others and power pushed into the skill level 29+ curve damage instead of bloating the synergies higher. Definitely want a focused elemental build to be stronger, but would like other builds to be viable to at least farm with and have fun doing it.</li>
  <li>Missile speeds for multiple spells have been increased to ease positioning issues in the high density D2RR environment.</li>
