<p><span class="text-big">Advanced tweaks like these were from the efforts of various gamers &amp; would not have been possible without the community on Discord. &nbsp;Please join the growing team of gamers &amp; let us reimagine the future together!</span></p>
<p><mark class="pen-red">IMPORTANT: Because most of the options below either adjust a single file or alter many files, when a new version of Reimagined gets installed you will have to reapply every tweak manually afterwards. &nbsp;Keep this in mind when deciding which of these are of interest. &nbsp;You could use all of them together if you wanted.</mark></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><mark class="pen-red">NOTE: These are advanced game changes, where extra steps are required beyond the basic game &amp; mod installation. &nbsp;<u>It is recommended to first experience the mod as it is before attempting these advanced changes.</u> &nbsp;Some of these were found by players &amp; others by the mod developers, so support is not guaranteed. &nbsp;Please follow the steps &amp; instructions. &nbsp;Be ready &amp; willing to reinstall the game before continuing. &nbsp;<u>Wise to backup your saved game folder too when first installing the Expanded Stash.</u></mark></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><u>Expanded Stash</u></p>
<p>This increases the shared stash tabs from 3 to 7. &nbsp;Every additional tab is able to hold 2.5M gold, so this increases the total amount of gold that can be held too.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><u>Forced Terror Zones</u></p>
<p>This forces the following very popular zones to always be terrorized! &nbsp;While changing your computer system's clock can extend throne of destruction or cow level sessions, keeping the popular areas terrorized makes your efforts easier.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><u>Potion &amp; Scroll removal from most monster drops</u></p>
<p>With potions and scrolls no longer dropping from most mobs, missing important gear becomes less of an issue.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><u>Remove the Splash Charm's dust graphic</u></p>
<p>By default when using the Splash Charm, a giant cloud of dust is present letting the gamer know how large the area for the effect is covering. &nbsp;You can turn off this graphic, while the damage will continue to hit mobs making it easier to see things while fighting &amp; is a little easier on your graphics card.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><u>Expanded Aspect Ratio limit</u> (19% zoomed out)</p>
<p>This increases the viewable area on-screen, where Blizzard has allowed upto 19:10 ratio to be used in the game. &nbsp;This allows players to teleport horizontally much faster than a typical 16:9 ratio. &nbsp;Currently the steps listed are for Nvidia video card users only, works on 1080p &amp; 4k monitors too.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><u>Much Faster Loading game</u></p>
<p>This reduces the amount of time it takes for both the game's initial loading and also reduces the loading screens when changing inbetween acts/zones. &nbsp;This has been reported to remove microstutters &amp; slightly reduce the minimum system requirements (except for the hard drive game storage size requirement).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h1><u>Expanded Stash</u></h1>
<p>This increases the shared stash tabs from 3 to 7. &nbsp;Every additional tab is able to hold 2.5M gold, so this increases the total amount of gold that can be held too.</p>
<p><mark class="pen-red">Before installing this you must empty your shared stash tabs or risk losing items! &nbsp;You can create new character mules to temporarily hold the items &amp; then move them back after the installation.</mark></p>

<h1><u>Forced Terror Zones</u></h1>
<p>This forces the following very popular zones to always be terrorized! &nbsp;While changing your computer system's clock can extend throne of destruction or cow level sessions, keeping the popular areas terrorized makes things easier.</p>
<ol>
  <li>Navigate to your game installation and find this file: \Diablo II Resurrected\mods\Reimagined\Reimagined.mpq\data\hd\global\excel\desecratedzones.json</li>
  <li>Backup this file somewhere else so that you can undo this tweak when you wish to run other Terrorized Zones not included in this list.</li>
  <li>Download the modified file here and replace it in the location shown in the first step.</li>
  <li><u>Now the following levels are permanently terrorized:</u> Countess, Summoner, Nilathak, Andy, Meph, CS, Throne of Destruction, Baal, Cows</li>
</ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h1><u>Potion &amp; Scroll removal from most monster drops</u></h1>
<p>With potions and scrolls mostly gone off the ground, missing important gear becomes less of an issue.</p>
<p>This will remove health &amp; mana potions from most trash mobs, however certain boss/quest/champions may have forced potion drops still. &nbsp;After applying if you need potions, visit the vendor.</p>
<ol>
  <li>Navigate to the treasureclassex.txt and open it with notepad.</li>
  <li>Press CTRL + F (or on the menu go to edit, find) and search for these two lines listed below. &nbsp;After deleting both lines, close notepad and click save &amp; both potion types should no longer be dropping. &nbsp;<u>Search for &amp; delete these two lines:</u></li>
