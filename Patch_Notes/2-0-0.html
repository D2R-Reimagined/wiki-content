    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Gem Bag &amp; Keychain grabbers can be purchased from vendors - use these to retrieve desired contents from storage</li>
  <li>All stacked items have been renamed to "Stack: {X}" to make them easier to identify as a Stack (in addition to the + sign)</li>
  <li>Updated tooltips for Gem Bag, Keychain, Item Stacks and Grabbers to make them easier to understand</li>
  <li>Updated Rune/Rune Stack names to “(#X)” to make it clearer it denotes their rune number and not stack quantity.</li>
  <li>Several helmets can now roll up to 4 sockets</li>
  <li>As stamina is now infinite, stamina shrines, stamina regeneration effects on items, and stamina potions have been removed</li>
  <li>'Extra Bone Spear' added to wands and Necromancer heads as a random affix for magic, rare, crafted items, but can no longer shotgun</li>

      <li>New String: "+X% Chance Items Roll as Magic or Better"</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>
<h3>Item Upgrades</h3>
<p>The old 'Add Item Stats' system (and all of its recipes) has been scrapped and a new system, 'Item Upgrades', is being introduced.</p>
<p>Items can now only be upgraded a certain number of times per item slot and will no longer increase level requirements when upgraded. Check the Wiki Item Upgrades page for more details!</p>
<h3>Power Orbs</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Added Orb of Assemblage: Upgrades a Rare base item to a Set item of the same type. Shares drop rate with Orb of Conversion</li>
  <li>Added Orb of Infusion: Upgrades a white item (or magic Jewelry) to a Rare item of the same type. Can drop from any monster on any difficulty. Roughly 3x the drop chance of Conversion/Assemblage Orbs.</li>

          <li>All items must be clicked twice in order to fully corrupt (now always consumes the Orb)</li>
          <li>Any item already clicked twice will now return the item and the Orb while still making the transmute sound so the player can be confident the process is complete</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>Belts can now corrupt 10% faster cast rate</li>
      <li>Renamed 'Corruption Orb' to 'Orb of Corruption' to bring it in-line with other Power Orbs</li>
      <li>Orb of Corruption drop chance has been reduced back to intended values</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Conversion Orb outcome no longer tied to clvl - mules can now convert to their heart's content</li>
  <li>Socket Orbs can now drop from Champion / Unique / Super Unique and Boss monsters in Nightmare Terror Zones</li>
  <li>Power Orbs have been updated to use sprites unique to Re-Imagined</li>

      </li>
    </ul>

  <li>Reduced MaxRes/MaxAllRes on all items to make it more difficult to achieve 95% resistances</li>
  <li>Reduced many outstanding ele-absorb % to make it more difficult to achieve god-like status</li>
  <li>Affixes for +XP% have been reduced across the board to make getting to max level an achievement</li>
  <li>Replaced all time-based attributes with flat values (e.g. Runeword 'Night')</li>
  <li>Removed/replaced stats on Armor items that had both %Enhanced Damage and Min/Max damage to prevent %Enhanced Damage on armor items not applying properly to the player. Bug/Code Limitation from vanilla D2.<ul>
      <li>This change does not prevent the bug from re-occurring if %Enhanced Damage or combination %ED and Min/Max jewels are socketed into armors.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>
<h3>Gem Changes</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Gem qualities below 'perfect' have been removed. Perfect gems renamed to: Amethyst, Topaz, Sapphire, Emerald, Diamond, Ruby, Skull<ul>
      <li>*Note, some monsters have hardcoded inferior quality gems as part of their loot table. Add these to the gem bag for credits</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Gems now drop from A2 Normal (Arcane Sanctuary) - require level 18 to use</li>
  <li>Gem drop chances increased slightly in Normal, decreased in Nightmare and Hell (see Gem Bag changes below)</li>
  <li>Gem colors updated to turquoise to differentiate them from other items (no more rainbow effects).</li>
  <li>Gem Bag has been reworked: now accepts all gems as universal credits (max storage of ~65,000)</li>
  <li>Gem Bag now accepts up to 99 assorted gems at a time (no longer bound by gem type)</li>
  <li>Gem Grabbers retrieve a single, appropriate gem. Cycle grabbers by cubing them alone.</li>
  <li>Gem Grabbers have been removed for inferior qualities</li>
  <li>Various Horadric Cube recipes that used inferior gem qualities have either been updated (e.g. 35% rejuv now requires 1 HP + 1 MP + 1 Gem. Full requires 3 HP + 3MP + 1 Gem), or removed entirely given their infrequent use (chipped/flawed/normal/flawless, etc.)</li>
  <li>Gem Shrines have been removed as their existing behavior is hardcoded</li>
</ul>
<h3>Runes</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Eld rune now grants +5 Life After Each Kill instead of reduced stamina drain.</li>
</ul>

<ul>

  <li>Last Wish has been slightly reworked to allow for 40-50 flat min, 80-100 flat max damage to roll and a slightly higher enhanced damage% range of 350-400.<ul>
      <li>Because item was at the stat limit the additional CB and MF% have been removed.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>
