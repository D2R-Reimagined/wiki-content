<h2 style="text-align:center;"><strong>Welcome to the D2R Reimagined Wiki!</strong></h2>
<p style="text-align:center;"><a href="https://www.d2r-reimagined.com/">Website</a> • <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/diablo2resurrected/mods/503">Nexus Mods Page</a> • <a href="https://discord.gg/5c2GrFQReE">Discord</a> •&nbsp;<a href="https://github.com/D2R-Reimagined/d2r-reimagined-mod">Github</a></p>
<p>Our Mission is to provide a Diablo II experience that is both familiar and new. We aim to keep the core gameplay of Diablo II intact while adding new features and content to the game to provide a fresh experience.</p>
<p>Everything we do is open source whether it be files edits, or mod tools. We believe that the community should have the ability to see and modify the code that runs the mod. We also believe that the community should have the ability to contribute to the mod and help shape its future.</p>
<p>Want to be apart of this mission? Join our Discord Server <a href="https://discord.gg/9zZkYrSA8C">https://discord.gg/9zZkYrSA8C</a> for more information on contributing and collaborating.</p>

<p>This mod is mainly edited and maintained by the community and not a single individual and therefore the changes that are made are not always properly credited or the inspiration for the changes shared or given. In our enthusiasm for being new to modding, having fun, learning new things, and just trying out various modding tools and tips provided by members of the community we may have missed something someone feels like they should receive credit for, so please reach out on Discord, through GitHub or on Reddit and we will do our best to credit original authors where applicable.</p>
