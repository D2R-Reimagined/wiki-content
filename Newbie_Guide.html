<blockquote>
  <p><mark class="pen-red"><strong>IMPORTANT:</strong></mark></p>
  <p>Storing a large quantity of small items (Small Charms, Large Charms, Grand Charms, Jewels, Rings, Amulets, Belts, Etc.) in your Personal Stash and/or Horadric Cube in between game sessions (Save and Exit) can drastically increase the file size of your character which has a limit of 8192 on disk or around 8KB.</p>
  <p>Keep any items smaller than a grid size of 2x2 in Shared Tabs if using Personal tab for rune/orb stack storage. If you store Rune and Orb stacks in your personal tab, keep them stacked together, a stack of 100 quantity takes up less file space than 2 stacks of 1 quantity.&nbsp;</p>
  <p>Failure to be aware of the file size limit and follow these basic guidelines will eventually result in items disappearing!</p>
  <p><mark class="pen-red">Never use the Horadric Cube for in between game storage, (Save and Exit), items disappear quite often even if the file size has not reached the limit above.</strong></mark></p>
