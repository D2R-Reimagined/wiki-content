<h2 style="text-align:center;"><strong>Welcome to the D2R Reimagined Wiki!</strong></h2>
<p style="text-align:center;"><a href="https://www.d2r-reimagined.com/">Website</a> • <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/diablo2resurrected/mods/503">Nexus Mods Page</a> • <a href="https://discord.gg/5c2GrFQReE">Discord</a> •&nbsp;<a href="https://github.com/D2R-Reimagined/d2r-reimagined-mod">Github</a></p>
<p>Our Mission is to provide a Diablo II experience that is both familiar and new. We aim to keep the core gameplay of Diablo II intact while adding new features and content to the game to provide a fresh experience.</p>
<p>Everything we do is open source whether it be files edits, or mod tools. We believe that the community should have the ability to see and modify the code that runs the mod. We also believe that the community should have the ability to contribute to the mod and help shape its future.</p>
<p>Want to be apart of this mission? Join our Discord Server <a href="https://discord.gg/9zZkYrSA8C">https://discord.gg/9zZkYrSA8C</a> for more information on contributing and collaborating.</p>
