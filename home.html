<h2 style="text-align:center;"><strong>Welcome to D2R Reimagined Wiki!</strong></h2>
<p style="text-align:center;">The D2R Reimagined Project is a community driven Diablo 2 Resurrected mod that breaths new life into Diablo 2 Resurrected while keeping a similar vibe to the vanilla game.</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><a href="https://www.d2r-reimagined.com/">Website</a> • <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/diablo2resurrected/mods/503">Nexus Mods Page</a> • <a href="https://discord.gg/5c2GrFQReE">Discord</a></p>
<p><span class="text-big"><strong>Our Mission</strong></span> is to provide a Diablo II experience that is both familiar and new. We aim to keep the core gameplay of Diablo II intact while adding new features and content to the game. We want to provide a fresh experience for players who have played Diablo II for years, while also providing a fun and engaging experience for new players.</p>
<p>Everything we do, regardless if that is the D2R Files themselves or any of the tooling we build, is open source. We believe that the community should have the ability to see and modify the code that runs the mod. We also believe that the community should have the ability to contribute to the mod and help shape its future.</p>
<p>Want to be apart of this mission? Join our Discord Server <a href="https://discord.gg/9zZkYrSA8C">https://discord.gg/9zZkYrSA8C</a> for more information on contributing and collaborating.</p>
